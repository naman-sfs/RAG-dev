Hello, I'm Doctor Fujian Z. I'm a\\n\\npsychotherapist and the originator of the awareness Integration theory. And I would like to share all\\n\\nof those with you today. I'm so grateful to um ship network and sister Jenna um for creating this\\n\\nopportunity so that we could be together and talk about how to reset your life, how to core your life\\n\\nin the way that you would be fulfilled. So the first thing that we actually do need is awareness,\\n\\nhaving the observation, looking at different areas of our life and looking at what is it that I am um\\n\\nthat I desire, what uh areas of my life do I feel fulfilled? So let's look together, we're going to create\\n\\nthis time and session so that you will look into your life. So if you are in a place that you could\\n\\nactually sit down and jot down uh some of your answers as we go through this type of observation,\\n\\nbeautiful. And if not, then um kinda work with me with your visualization and your thought process.\\n\\nSo we could go through this journey together. Let's look at your life. What areas of your life do you\\n\\nfeel fulfilled that um let's look at your relationship with your body and with your health. Are you\\n\\nhappy with the way that you look? Do you feel fulfilled? Um Do you like more of the things about\\n\\nyour body than what you don't like about your body? Do you feel healthy when you kind of close\\n\\nyour eyes and go into your body and kind of scan from top to bottom? I, I feel like I'm grateful and\\n\\nthat it's at ease and calm and there's a way that I can be with it or there are areas of your body that\\n\\nyou feel pain or you feel you haven't really um taken care of it for a while or you haven't even been\\n\\nlooking at it. You haven't held gratitude for different areas of your body. Kind of like taking it for\\n\\ngranted. And the minute that one part doesn't work, then we get all Huffy and Buffy is like, how dare\\n\\nit doesn't work. So maybe it's one of those vehicles that although you're in it and you need it, but\\n\\nyou're not really taking care of it or you do or if the areas that you do take care of, but maybe other\\n\\nareas you don't. So jot it down, think about it kind of, uh, figure out which one it is that you, um, you\\n\\nknow, you, you feel good about yourself or not in the area of marriage and intimate relationship. If\\n\\nyou are in a relationship or if you used to be in one or if you are, um, in a marriage right now, are\\n\\nyou fulfilled in that area? And what parts of it make you really, really feel fulfilled and what parts no,\\n\\nstill need some work or you feel resentful or there are areas you haven't really worked on. Uh,\\n\\nthere's something maybe about yourself that you haven't really, uh, put all of you 100% in there and\\n\\nmaybe areas of men, but they haven't, uh, you expect something from them. They're just not\\n\\nbringing it onto the table. So, what areas of your life in the, uh, marriage and intimate relationship do\\n\\nyou feel fulfilled in what areas you don't relationship with Children. If you have Children, if you have\\n\\ndifferent types of Children, girls have a boy, you have different ages, you have a teenager, which\\n\\ndoesn't let you really feel like you're fulfilled. Um, what about that? What areas do you feel like?\"),\n",

Well, I just don't\\n\\nfeel like I'm equipped or, I don't feel like I'm doing the best thing. I'm not the greatest mother or\\n\\nfather in the area of career finances. What is it that you feel good? You feel like a success in\\n\\ncreating this moving forward in what area is that like? Hm. Not where I wanna be, I'm not playing big\\n\\nenough or I'm not, uh you know, at the, at the space of security that I want or um, I don't have the\\n\\ntitles or I don't have the significance that I want.

And uh you can pat\\n\\nyourself on the back and say I got it. I did this and I'm proud that I did this. These are my skills and\\n\\nI'm so happy that I got those um in the area of family relation, maybe your siblings, your mom, your\\n\\ndad, um cousins or you know, uh uncles and aunts. Yeah, how about those relationships in the\\n\\nextended family in laws? Um What is in those areas that you really like? And even your friends, the\\n\\nsocial relation in all of those areas? What is it that you feel fulfilled and awesome and part of and uh\\n\\nfeel connected and what areas you hear like? No, it's just not there. I don't feel it, I don't feel\\n\\nconnected with all of it. So imagine all of those areas of your life and that is it balanced? Is it not\\n\\nbalanced? And what makes you not fulfilled in any of those areas? And then we go back to the past,\\n\\nwhat areas of your life are you not complete with something in the past that still kind of follows you\\n\\nas if you weren't complete with it yet. Kind of lingers on like a heavy baggage that wherever you go,\\n\\nyou take yourself with you and all the baggage and even if you're creating amazing results in your\\n\\nlife, hm. They're kind of coming at you or with you. Um are there goals that you intended to have?\\n\\nAnd you just said, don't worry about it not gonna do it. Are there goals that you attempted? You\\n\\nreally tried but hm did not um acquire it. It just didn't work out and you may feel resentful, you might\\n\\nfeel victimized. You may feel like you're a failure and those are coming. And what areas do you feel\\n\\nlike success that I did? It. I did every step. I really put the effort. I really, the vision and guess what? I\\n\\ngot it and I'm proud of myself for getting it. And now that I have the skills to get it in the area of um\\n\\nlove relationships, were there any of the past relationships that you're not complete? A part of you\\n\\nstill just wishes a part of you is angry, um, feel like you are betrayed and it wasn't fair a part of you\\n\\nthat kind of wonders what happened. Like my relationship dissolved and I don't even know what\\n\\nhappened. I don't have all the answers and I wish, wish, wish, wish um are there any of those\\n\\nrelationships that are all still hanging out in your system and that you need to complete with? Is\\n\\nthere any uh traumas that you went through childhood abuse, childhood traumas, childhood, um\\n\\nsexual abuse, uh molestations, uh physical abuse, uh poverty. You were in a situation that it was\\n\\nharsh uh violence. Um uh parents weren't in the best shape or maybe a parent was ill and just\\n\\ncouldn't be there for you. Any type of childhood issues that you still carry on and the hurt is there\\n\\nand the pain is there. And it's just like the um all the coping mechanisms that you created, which\\n\\nmade you survive, but also limits you as we go along. Any type of um negative belief you created\\n\\nabout yourself out of those traumas out of something that your mom and dad said to you out of\\n\\nsomething that a bully in the school said to you out of. Um, you know, the first one that you loved\\n\\nand they cheated on you. Did you make those about you? Did you say that? Um I am not good\"),\n",

Uh what\\n\\nare some of the things that you really desire to create? Um You want to manifest them in the future\\n\\nin the area of your body and health? Is there a particular weight? Do you wanna be? Is there a\\n\\nparticular shape you wanna be? Is there a particular health consideration that you wanna be\\n\\nhealthy? And for your age and moving forward, beautiful for your age and you're moving forward.\\n\\nAre there any future that calls you forward?

Can you envision this beautiful um intimate and close\\n\\nrelationship, a sexual relationship, a heartfelt relationship that you could have and um that you see\\n\\nyourself and you know, you shine and you feel like bliss and it's as if I deserve this. Yeah, I deserve\\n\\nthis. Not only that I bring this to the relationship, I also deserve to gain it. Have it be it and um see\\n\\nmyself with someone until I'm dead until um you know, we both just enjoy every minute of the sunset\\n\\nof the sunrise of sleeping, eating, walking, all of those areas that, that working together. Anything\\n\\nthat you want to have, what is in the future that calls you for relationships with your family members,\\n\\nwith your friends, with your siblings, with your Children, um with the society, what type of relationship\\n\\ncalls you and says this is what I intend to be in your profession, in your career. What do you see?\\n\\nWhat is it that you want to be? What, what kind of an impact you actually want to create? Who do\\n\\nyou want to impact? And as you see yourself, this future that calls you, what kind of a career is it? Is\\n\\nyour passion there? Is your creativity. There is your abundance, there is the prosperity of who you\\n\\nare with all of you there and watching it kind of like look at everything and bouncing it off and getting\\n\\nto see how it works with everyone when it comes to the area of finance, what is it, what are the\\n\\ndollar amounts that you desires that, that you intend to create, that you uh what are all the tangible\\n\\nresults that is considered wealth that you see in your life? I deserve this. I work for it. I work hard for\\n\\nit and I deserve to have it all. And but I feel blissed as I live here in every area of my life is the way\\n\\nthat I say I want it to be and I'm free to live in that space. Remember, these are your criteria, they're\\n\\nnot societal criterias, they're not your family's criteria, they're your criteria. You get to choose to\\n\\ncreate and core this vision um as you move forward. So what does it mean for us to be able to\\n\\ndistinguish between all of it? One of the most important factors is to really look at um areas of our\\n\\nlife and what goes on inside. There's a way that um we can look at and observe and distinguish\\n\\nbetween our thoughts, feelings, actions and impact. So our thoughts are those words that go around\\n\\nyour head, you hear them, you listen to them, um you hear them through uh a formula because our\\n\\nbrain and uh the frontal cortex of our brain constantly creates a new model of the world as we grow\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 's3://drfoojandocuments/ai-videos-2024/pdfs_Aug_2024/Tip_of_the_day_-_English/1.Tip_of_the_day_-_English-transcript.pdf'}, page_content=\"your head, you hear them, you listen to them, um you hear them through uh a formula because our\\n\\nbrain and uh the frontal cortex of our brain constantly creates a new model of the world as we grow\\n\\nup, as we hear our messages from our families and friends and schools and teachers and peers.\\n\\nAnd so all the experiences we have, we stopped forming these wonderful and sometimes harsh um\\n\\nstories, storylines, narratives um about who we are, about who I am in the world and about who the\\n\\nworld is and what should be and things should be this way or the other. And if you do this and this\\n\\nhappens, and then we create all of these narration and put them together as a model in our hat. And\\n\\nthen we live by that moment. Sometimes we create the Wizard of Oz movie. Sometimes we create\\n\\nthis beautiful, wonderful world movie. Sometime we create a horror movie as if like anywhere I go,\\n\\nsomebody's gonna harm me. I gotta watch what's happening with me. So then you, you will\\n\\nexperience anything that you show you created as you were growing up and picking up all of the\\n\\ndata and information through your own experience or the community's experience or the country's\\n\\nexperience or generation after generation experience that was just handed to you and you took\\n\\nthem on as if it was true. So we take in experiences belief systems, uh myths, all of them are gonna\\n\\nbe there as our thought process. And as we create this, any new type of experience we get or\\n\\ninformation or data kind of goes through those reference points and picks up and add, adds itself to\\n\\nthose types of ideas. So it's important for you to see what are your thought process? What do you\\n\\nthink about relationships? What do you think about women or men? What do you think about, you\\n\\nknow, white, black, brown, yellow, whatever. What do you think about all of those? How do you\\n\\ncreate those thoughts and uh how do those thoughts and negative beliefs might harm you, hold you\\n\\nback versus move you forward and really be great? And as you move forward, what are your\\n\\nfeelings like? She's looking at the positive feelings that you have that moves you forward? It makes\\n\\nyou want to live, it creates excitement, it creates you joy, keeps all of that more uncomfortable\\n\\nfeelings that you might have. Um there might be sadness of fear and shame and anxiety and anger\\n\\nand rage and a disappointment. And um those are there too. They all have a message for you\\n\\naspect of your feeling has a message for you. And it's important to see what message they are take\\n\\non the message, come back, release the emotion, express the emotion to whomever it needs to be\\n\\ndone and then move on and do the action that you need to create for the emotion to, you know, just\\n\\ngo through the emotion that is telling you the message and pick up the message and move forward.\\n\\nWhat kind of actions do you do? What kind of words do you use? Do you harm people? Do you\\n\\nelate people? Do you do things for people? Do you think against people and look at all of them? And\\n\\nwe all have both, we all have, you know, uh constructive and moving forward, thoughts and\\n\\nemotions and actions. And we have really limiting and destructive thoughts, feelings and actions.\\n\\nAnd in order for you to look at your life and different areas and to say, how is it that I need to\\n\\ndetermine what works and what doesn't you first have to be able to distinguish between your\\n\\nthoughts, belief systems, feelings, actions, which those create this type of an attitude. So your\\n\\nthoughts and feelings are internal by the time they become an action immediately becomes internal\\n\\nto external. And then there is an impact. Every action you do, every word you say every nonverbal\\n\\ncues that you give us an action, everything you do for someone, all of those intentions you have that\\n\\nare internal, the shifting to an action to get uh implemented and manifested has an impact. It has an\\n\\nimpact on your life and it has an impact on everyone who's around you. And a lot of times with the\"),\n",

And a lot of times with the\\n\\nbigger picture on the whole world together. So it's important for you to also take responsibility of\\n\\nwhat actions you have done that has promoted you is promoted other people. It's gotten you closer\\n\\nto us. It's gotten you healthier as you move forward. And what are some of the actions that you've\\n\\ndone that impacted in a way that destroyed you destroyed others, destroyed relationships limited\\n\\nthe, a lot of the actions didn't allow you to shine and other people to see you shine and to promote\\n\\nrelationships that were healthy or you have created and impacted people in a way that the\\n\\nrelationships were not fulfilling and were not moving forward. All of these observations and the\\n\\nrelationship that you had with people and the projections and the assumptions that you have about\\n\\npeople having about you, whether you think they're scared of you or they think they love you or they\\n\\nthink they're jealous of you or they think they're intending beautiful, uh beautiful essence and wishes\\n\\nand prayers for you or you think they're intending for you to fail and for them to raise. So whatever\\n\\nprojections and assumptions that you're creating, um it's part of that relationship and then\\n\\nremember, you always take yourself everywhere. So you also have a relationship with you with\\n\\nothers. So wherever you go, not only you relate to them, but you also have a relationship with\\n\\nyourself. If you are at work and your customer or boss or whomever it is, you have a relationship\\n\\nwith them, you have an assumption of how they relate to you. And then beside them, you think of\\n\\nyourself or feel about yourself in a particular way which chooses usually the self esteem and\\n\\nself-confidence as you move along the the world in any type of action. So the awareness of how you\\n\\nthink, how you feel, how you behave and the impact in the way you relate to the world, in the way\\n\\nyou assume the world relates to you. And in the way you relate to yourself, as you go along with\\n\\ndifferent relationship, the key to see whether you're going to uh feel fulfilled and create a life that you\\n\\nare excited about and fulfill or that you create a life that you feel miserable and you're constantly in a\\n\\ncomplaining mode and a victimized mode which you don't deserve to be, you deserve to be in a\\n\\nrelationship with yourself and the world that elates you excites you. Um So then we go into the, as\\n\\nyou go through the observation and there might be some element of integration that you might have\\n\\nwith different parts of you that just wasn't unfinished, it wasn't finished up in whatever it was in all of\\n\\nthe belief systems you created when you were two or five and 10 and 13, which never kind of got\\n\\ninto integrated to the you who is here now with all the beauty with the strength that you have with\\n\\nskills that you have. And maybe those parts of you don't know that you've gained these skills and\\n\\nthey've got to come back and integrate together so that you become a whole. There's so many ways\\n\\nof being able to integrate. The point would be for you to be nurturing to those parts of you listening\\n\\nto them, seeing them asking them, what is it that they need? What is it that they wanted that they\\n\\nnever got and telling them that you come from their future to them and letting them know you\\n\\nsurvived. You're here with all the skills and that you hear you and that you will be able to give you\\n\\nwhat you need and you will, if you don't know, you will find the skills to give you what you need and\\n\\nthat you don't need other people to give you that you will create it for yourself, even if it's the asking\\n\\nthe resources for others and how to be given to you, allowing yourself to heal, knowing that you\\n\\ndeserve to heal every aspect of you.

And then looking at living in an intentional world, if you have\\n\\nthe option, what you do, what values do you choose to live by? What values do you want desire to\\n\\nhave in your thought process? What values do you intend to act on? So let yourself know what kind\\n\\nof values do you see in others that you cherish and you can take them on and say I own it now and\\n\\nI'm gonna take those values for myself. Look, create a vision as if you have a vision statement and a\\n\\nmission statement for yourself. So write them down. Look at all the thought process. Every thought\\n\\nthat you say from here on, I intend to think this way because this way of thinking works for me\\n\\ndoesn't limit me. It moves me forward, it expands me and allows me to play, it allows me to work, it\\n\\nallows me to connect. So these thought process are the ones that I'm in shoes and this other\\n\\nthought process which are negative and be limiting and hold me back and create reasons. And I just\\n\\ndon't want to think like that anymore. You don't have control about all the automatic thoughts that\\n\\nshow up, but you certainly have a lot of control in which one you're gonna pay attention to which one\\n\\nyou're gonna subscribe to which one you're gonna take have an ownership of and which one you're\\n\\ngoing to recite consistently in your brain and uh even share it through your words with other people.\\n\\nWhat kind of emotions do you choose to feel? You don't have all the options of choosing all the\\n\\nemotions as they show up. But again, you have the option and the skills to hold on to the emotions\\n\\nthat you like and release the emotions that you don't like. If you like joy and you wanna expand the\\n\\ntimes of the day that you experiencing joy, but then think about it. Do the body work to create joy, do\\n\\nthe exercises to experience and you know, throw all of the chemicals up there that you experience\\n\\njoy, think of thoughts that create joy, create visualizations that create joy. And if you're\\n\\nuncomfortable with your anger or s madness and fear and shame, then listen to them, honor them,\\n\\nfeel them, find out what, what message they have, promise that you will take care of that message\\n\\nand then release them from your body and move along to do something for yourself and then come\\n\\nback and do the things you need to do to go back into the experience of joy and happiness. If you\\n\\nfeel comfortable with your sadness and anger, but enjoy them, do whatever it is. Choose feelings\\n\\nthat you choose and are comfortable and feel related to have we live by our emotions and feelings.\\n\\nSo choose the ones that you deserve to live by and then choose the actions that you say you're\\n\\nproud, the actions that whoever sees you do. They can also be proud of you actions that don't have\\n\\nto go consistently and clean up actions that move you forward and not backwards or hold you back.\\n\\nActions that are not only for greater you but greater everyone and greater. All the people that are\\n\\naround you in the world at large because you live in that world with other people. So it can't be just\\n\\ngreater for you and not for them and then choose the impact that you like. And um As long as you\\n\\ncreate the thought process, emotion and action to go toward the creation of impact, you will have a\\n\\nhigher probability to create the impact that you actually intended. And if not, you can always go back\\n\\nand core it from with the people around you, the impact that you actually want and then create\\n\\nfeedback loops and um visual collages, audio messages for yourself, an accountability buddy, a\\n\\ngreat friend who will let you know and hold you up to those values and goals and things that you\\n\\nhave and said that it's gonna call me forward to remind you to be your mirror, to be your mentor.\\n\\nAnd um you're not alone. So don't act like you're alone. Ask for resources out there and have people\\n\\naround you, pick people around you that you feel safe, that you feel joyous about that they bring you\"),\n",

I find myself eating and at\\n\\none point, um, I suddenly opened my eyes and everything in the refrigerator is gone and I've gone\\n\\nthrough all the food and it's done in such an automatic way that I don't even realize it. I realize I\\n\\nstart, but I just don't realize when I finish and I'm consumed with the thoughts. So it seems like it\\n\\nreally triggers you when uh your boyfriend acts in a particular way or that you assume that you're not\\n\\ngoing to be with him. But it brings up a lot of the issues. Sometimes we have issues um, that are\\n\\nfrom our parents and the way that we were raised if there was any type of anxiety, um, as we were\\n\\ngrowing up. Um, and we had learned that when we get anxious, the only way to call myself was food\\n\\nand, you know, we do that a lot with Children. Um parents many times when somebody is upset and\\n\\noffer them food, food appears to be one of the concepts of socialization, being together, celebration.\\n\\nYou know, when we um we wanna watch a movie, we'll get popcorn, we'll sit down and we'll eat. So\\n\\neating um as we grow up has created a lot of different meanings for us. And not only that, it nurtures\\n\\nus as far as food and nutrients, but many times, we've used this socially in our families and as a\\n\\ngroup in a way of a buffer uh that it gives us something to do and it's together and we uh you know,\\n\\nenjoy the palate of our palate, just enjoys like salt and sugar and fat together. And it creates like a\\n\\ncomforting way of as if we're taking care of ourselves. Not true all the time because it depends on\\n\\nwhat you're eating. But whether you're gonna take care of yourself or not. But the other side of it is it\\n\\ngets associated with some of the emotions. Um where if I'm sad I could eat my way and feel happy\\n\\nor if I'm angry I could eat and not be angry anymore or it becomes a distraction for us. Um So\\n\\ncomfort food, it might associate with pleasure, um comfort, uh distraction, um many other aspects.\\n\\nSo it depends on what you see food as um associated with. Beyond just nutrition that there is so I\\n\\ncan see where, uh, this person is, um, it's upset, gets fearful and, uh, the first thing they do is to go\\n\\nfeed it and try to comfort it. And then at one point they stop and they see that they are discomforted.\\n\\nAt this point, their stomach hurts and they, uh, kind of get disgusted with themselves. So, the, what,\\n\\nwhat they wanted to use as a tool to comfort and create pleasure. Now it has created more\\n\\ndiscomfort for them. So I, one thing to look at is what are all the ways that I can also release my\\n\\nemotions versus stuff them inside. So releasing a fear might be that you could write a letter, you\\n\\ncould do some reality check with what's going on. Remember what they said, check with them and\\n\\nsee how they are and whether you could see that, you know, that the relationship is actually going\\n\\nwell and it's, you know, your fear or unfounded or the fear are founded and there is something going\\n\\non, then maybe we could face it, we could talk about it, we could see what it is that we could solve,\\n\\nwe could move forward. So bringing whatever the emotion is and the message of the emotion,\\n\\nfeeling, it, containing it in our body. And then um reality doing reality check, talking to the person and\\n\\nfinding out whether that fear is substantial or not or if it's actual real, real or not. Then from there\\n\\ncreating a solution uh for that relationship and moving forward if that fear, not only comes from this\\n\\nrelationship, but it has the whole baggage of, you know, the way we were with our parents or our\\n\\nfirst love or kids who were at school, our friendships and we've lost and there's a grief and loss that\"),\n",

I need to still clear, what did I generalize\\n\\nabout myself or my or other people and kind of bringing all of those pieces together for ours uh in\\n\\norder to take care of herself and allowing food to be a part of reality, which is out there for nutrition,\\n\\nwhat would you use it for socialization and all other but to only stuff our feelings and not take, not\\n\\nhear them, run away from them and not take care of them is going to create a lot of more of\\n\\ndestruction uh for our life and doesn't really handle the original concept of is this relationship solid or\\n\\nnot?

I'm doctor Fu John Zain and I am with Amano Laga Raman. He is a master yoga\\n\\nteacher and a meditation teacher. And today he is going to share with us an amazing meditation\\n\\nhere you are. Take it away. Not much to everyone. Uh What we're gonna do today is uh excellent\\n\\ntechnique for uh cleansing, uh energetic cleansing, mental, emotional cleansing, and even physical\\n\\ncleansing and also helping your body to recover if you're sick or if you're tired or um exhausted. So\\n\\nit's a very effective simple process. And uh it's not just the meditation, it's a meditation visualization.\\n\\nSo I invite you to see the um straight back, relax your shoulder, relax your neck, relax your face and\\n\\njaw and breathe with your belly. And at the same time that you're breathing deeply, inhale and\\n\\nexhale. Imagine you're not only breathing through your nose or through your mouth, but it's like\\n\\nevery breath that you take in your whole body. Every cell will, every cell of your skin is breathing and\\n\\npulling this breath, this oxygen inside and with every exhale your whole body, every cell in your body\\n\\nis releasing what is not required anymore in your body, in your mind, in your emotion. So it's like\\n\\nyou're cleansing and you're filtering every breath that is coming in. And when you exhale, you send\\n\\nout what is not required for that cell, for that organ, for that, for the whole body. So we are just\\n\\nbreathing, inhale and exhale and imagine with every inhale, it's like your whole body is expanding\\n\\nand with every exhale your body the same way that your belly and your chest is contracting. Also,\\n\\nit's every cell is contracting and sending out what is not required anymore to be in your body, to be\\n\\nin every cell in your body and every thought or emotion that is not required anymore, that is not\\n\\nneeded. Ha that has served your body, mind and emotion is released from your body, from your\\n\\nmind and from your emotion, just breathe inhale and exit, breathe deeply and slowly. Now you can\\n\\nadd another thing you can add and imagine with every breath that you take in, you're not only\\n\\nbringing the, the air and oxygen and pro out to your body, you're also bringing light to your whole\\n\\nbody. So when you inhale, your whole body is absorbing oxygen, absorbing, energy, absorbing,\\n\\nlight, absorbing, peace, absorbing, relaxation and health. And with every exhale, you're releasing\\n\\nwhat is not required in your body, in every organ, in every cell of your body, in the field of your\\n\\nthoughts, in the field of your emotion, whatever is not needed is released. Just imagine, inhale and\\n\\nexhale. Take a deep breath. Now, check your body and see how much your body has been\\n\\nchanged, how much your mind has been changed, how much your emotion, your senses and your\\n\\nbreathing has been changed, make your breath come back and open your arms. It just felt like I was\\n\\ngoing deeper and deeper into meditation. Um This beautiful concept of just expanding and\\n\\ncontracting and expanding and contracting. It is uh not only the vision but the experience of it, it\\n\\nbrought it to a much more deeper level of uh of meditation for me. Um because of, you know, the\\n\\nthe the visualization was allowing me to um really focus on my body. So my mind got quieter much\\n\\nfaster and um the movement of the expansion and contraction also gave like a very soothing um\\n\\nexperience to it and very quickly um was going very much deeper and deeper.

We are with Amon Langa Harman who is a\\n\\nyoga master teacher. And uh he's going to let us know the most important thing in life, which is how\\n\\nto be in the present moment since we're always either in the past or the future. And we know\\n\\neverything happens in the present moment and that's the only place you can act and be present to.\\n\\nAnd here you go. I'm on a look. Please let us know how to be in the present moment and how to\\n\\nkeep coming back to the present moment. Excellent, great question. So uh we normally we are\\n\\noperating either in the past or in the future. So in yoga, we have a very effective access to it. Do you\\n\\nknow what part of you always is in the present time? But it's not exactly our body is the only part of\\n\\nus is always in present, even if my mind is in the past or future, my body is in present. So the whole\\n\\ntechnique that we are using in yoga, the access that we are using it is how to be connected to the\\n\\nbody. The axis is body. Now, your five senses combine with your breathing, your breathing, with\\n\\nyour five senses. Now, just breathe inhale and exhale and bring your attention to your hearing. Hear\\n\\nall the far and close sounds and noises and just breathe deeply and slowly bring your attention to\\n\\nyour uh taste buds. Yes. Uh Actually, uh after hearing, bring your attention to your smell, I smell\\n\\nevery breath that you take in exhale. Now, bring your attention to your uh torch, feel your seat where\\n\\nyou're sitting or you're standing, feel your feet on the floor or inside the shoes or how you feel uh the\\n\\nfabric of your outfit on your skin or if there is a draft, feel the air around your skin. So that's your\\n\\ntorch. Now bring your attention to your taste. My mouth is dry or wet. You like your taste of your\\n\\nmouth or you don't like it. That's not important. It's important to be present to it. And then last, but\\n\\nnot least be present to your sight either way as if your eyes are closed or open, be present to the\\n\\nlight, make a deep breath, exhale, come back and see how much you are in your in present time.\\n\\nWhat was interesting for me when you said that is uh not only that we come in the present moment,\\n\\nbut we still have uh um a commentary about it. I like, I don't like you know, and all of the\\n\\ncommentaries that show up also with the present moment. Um but I really got present to uh my\\n\\nsurrounding and my body a lot and just like, you know, it's right here. It just comes right here.\\n\\nExactly. Now who guarantees to come back and who guarantees you stay in this state? Is you how\\n\\nyou can guarantee it by repeating it, keeping it and bringing it back. Exactly. You do it again and\\n\\nagain and again and how we do it. Very simple. Like daily event in our life. You take a shower in the\\n\\nmorning, enjoy your shower, feel it, feel the feel the water on your shoulder, feel the warmth of it,\\n\\nfeel the cold of it be present to it and having your coffee, having your tea, feel it, smell it, taste it,\\n\\nlook at the color of it. So experience your five senses every moment, use your five senses for\\n\\nexperiencing things. Um Very simple. You'll find a very nice new uh fabric, feel it, um smell the\\n\\nroses. Very simple. It's just doing this daily and utilize it. And you the first time I learned this\\n\\ntechnique, I was 21 I realized, oh my God, I have not been in my body most of the time I was\\n\\nsomewhere and I was not experiencing this body. And when I came to my body, then I realized one\\n\\nof the reasons I don't wanna be in the body because I had so much pain as a young person. I had\\n\\nlots of issues and, uh, sicknesses. But the technique that bring me to my body and my access is my\\n\\ncrew five senses. Now, do you know what is the best way that your body tells you? You're not in it.\\n\\nPain and uncomfortableness. Yeah. Yeah. My, my right leg is telling me I've been sitting too long.\\n\\nYeah. Some people are sitting certain way and after, oh my God. Oh yes. Pain is a language of your\"),\n",

We're back here with tip of the day. I am so excited to have Amano Laga Raman\\n\\nwith me. He is a master yoga teacher, my master yoga teacher. I um he taught me yoga. So I\\n\\nwanted all of you guys to also have him. Now, we, we are in an era that we, we're all going through\\n\\na lot of stress, going through a lot of anxiety, a lot of emotions, they're all over the place. And I know\\n\\nthat as far as you know, I've shared with you the psychological tips on what you could do in order to\\n\\nlet go of those thoughts and let go of those um type of emotions. But today, we're bringing you some\\n\\nother ways of handling physi, your physiology and letting go. And um Amman is gonna teach us all\\n\\nof those. So thank you for coming to the show, my pleasure and thank you for inviting me. Tell us\\n\\nwhat can we do in order to let go of all of this anxiety and anger and emotions that are bubbling up.\\n\\nSure. Sure. Uh what I can say is uh this, these two techniques that I'm gonna show you is back to\\n\\nback. It's like a package together and what it has, it's, it helps us to either to go through a high level\\n\\nof anger or sadness. We can shift it and I assume your, uh, viewers they know about the mental part\\n\\nof it and they already know, ok, I take my mind off of this conversation or whatever. I make me worry\\n\\nbut still I feel it in my body. I don't feel relaxed or I feel anger still in my whole body. I can feel it. So\\n\\neven though you did mental parts of it, how you can do something that integrate that knowledge now\\n\\nwith your body and shift the whole thing. Now these two technique is very simple and um I uh invite\\n\\nyou to just let your uh inner tribe come out. Also if you felt uh you wanna be playful, that's totally OK.\\n\\nSo the first one is like this, just imagine you have a large cake in front of you full of candles and you\\n\\nwanna blow all of them. Just imagine you're 100 years old and you have 100 candle on it and you\\n\\nwanna blow all of them, you inhale, fill up your lung and when you want to blow it, you bring it to the\\n\\nuh chins cheeks and blow it out with the lips like this with the sound without sound, it doesn't create\\n\\nthat vibration with your lips. So with the sound we are gonna do three of these breath in here, right?\\n\\nTwo more, one more now, slowly coming up, come back, be present and you can feel it around your\\n\\nlips. This bubbly feeling is perfect. I can feel it, I can feel it right around here. I can feel it here. And\\n\\nthen as I go down, I feel it like the air is coming out because I'm, I'm going this way. So the air is\\n\\npushing and it's bringing it out and it's like being a child again and having fun, you know, with some\\n\\nfriends. So it's really like it's a giggly way of feeling. Yeah. And the second part of it is like a package\\n\\nwith this. It's very simple from the bottom. Uh It's like laughing from the bo uh from belly laugh, but\\n\\nthe intention is not laughing. The intention is cleaning your lung, emptying the whatever uh air that\\n\\nyou has stayed in the bottom of your lung, especially when the stress is so high, we don't breathe\\n\\nfully. We breathe very short with the top. So we wanna exhale and send out everything and clear all\\n\\nthe air and it's like this very simple in here and exhale with your belly and with looks like laughing\\n\\nlike this two more ah and 11 and it's slowly coming up and check your body, check your mind and\\n\\ncheck your emotion and see how much everything has been shifted. No cheeks go up. So cheeks\\n\\nare growing up here. So it feels like, you know, you can't really be pissed or upset anyway. And then\\n\\nI think it has a more of a feel of your whole body of activated and not just your lungs, it's like that\\n\\nwhole, the whole body is kind of activated and it has a little bit more of, not just the, like the child\\n\\nplay that was with the first one, but it's more of like the intense happiness that just shows up with it.\\n\\nExactly. Exactly. Uh One of my students once told me I was on the phone. I was so pissed that you,\"),\n",

Uh One of my students once told me I was on the phone. I was so pissed that you,\\n\\nyou sh you showed me this technique the day before and I was, what did you say that?

You can\\n\\ndo it when you're driving, you can do, you can do it any time and it's shifting your energy and it\\n\\ndoesn't have your anger or your sadness stays in your body. When there is an emotion created in\\n\\nour body, we need to experience it. We should not suppress it, we should not deny it. We should let\\n\\nit go, let it move. And that these two techniques are great for moving it and letting go and clear your\\n\\nbody. Mind emotion. Thank you so much. Um for the simple techniques that are though, although\\n\\nthey're simple, they're very, uh, deep and they connect with you and release in a very in in depth\\n\\nway.

Welcome. We're going to give you some tip of the day with Amano Long a Raman.\\n\\nHe is the master yoga teacher and um he's going to let us know how to bring our body in balance.\\n\\nWe all talk about how much balance is important and where does it show up in our body? And a lot\\n\\nof people say I have no idea how to balance myself throughout the day, maybe throughout the day,\\n\\nI'm com you know, concentrating on one particular task and then it's hard for me to switch myself to\\n\\nsomething else. So how do we create this balance? Emanuela? Great. Thank you. Uh Actually, um\\n\\nthis is actually, I think it's very helpful, especially for men because thanks God, women have this\\n\\nability to be focused on one thing and also be aware of other things, but especially men, when we\\n\\nare focused too much on one thing, we missed a lot of stuff. So it's, it helps everybody and\\n\\nespecially men. Uh this uh process is a very simple process of breathing technique, but it's um\\n\\nworking with the left uh left brain and right brain. And um it's, it create balance, not only mental\\n\\nbalance, emotional balance, also physical balance, it bring balance in all of the three levels. Uh The\\n\\ntechnique is very simple. We're gonna breathe and we close our right nostril and breathe through\\n\\nthe left nostril. So it's very simple one in head through your left nostril, an exhale from the same\\n\\nnostril again, one more a in and other one and it was only three. You can go for five or seven. Now\\n\\nwe change it. You put your left hand on your left nostril and breathe through your right and be sure\\n\\nthat you're not doing it with force. If you do it forcefully, you're gonna hurt your sinuses. Do it very\\n\\ncalm and relax. Breathe deeply and slowly with no rush. One X A two x-ray three A. So we did 3 to 5\\n\\non the right and we do 3 to 5 to the left. OK? It's opening up, it's opening up my nostrils a lot and it's\\n\\nbringing um bringing kind of like focus back into my system and it's interesting to know what the\\n\\ndifference are like. One of them is easier to breathe in and another one, it's uh maybe harder to\\n\\nbreathe in. But as I did it, it started opening up for me. Exactly. And then you put the three fingers on\\n\\nyour forehead and use this thumb and index of your right uh of your right hand. So I closed my left\\n\\nnostril with my in uh pinky inhale from my right nostril close my right and exert from my left nostril\\n\\nnow, inhale from my left X from my right inhale from my right. Exhale from my left inhale from my left\\n\\nexcept from my right. We do it 3 to 5 times this one. And now when you finish it, you what, what are\\n\\nyou present? What is your feeling right now? Light, the light in the room are so much more vivid. Um\\n\\nI taste completely like I, I was having tea so I can suddenly like the taste of tea. Although I haven't\\n\\nbeen having it while we're recording shows up suddenly because it was like left in my mouth. Uh My\\n\\nbreathing is much um more easier. It's just like I'm breathing um easier and I, and I have vibration\\n\\neven in my ears of hearing better. Yeah, exactly. Your five senses get sharper, the light gets warm\\n\\nand you feel your brain is in a another state of operation. Very simple, very simple. Now we did 3 to\\n\\n5 breaths. Can I do it a lot more? Sure you can do it even for five minutes. Now, look at this as an\\n\\nengineer or as a um accountant. Normally we are using a lot of left brain more than right.

And I want have a good time and I wanna come out of my left\\n\\ncalculative brain and I wanna active my right. Very simple. I close my right nostril and breathe from\\n\\nmy left. So when I'm breathing from left, I'm activating the right. And when I'm breathing from right,\\n\\nI'm activating the left. I can just do this for five minutes only with one side with no pressure. If you do\\n\\nit as strong, you don't want to hurt your sinuses. You do it calmly and relax. And when you do that,\\n\\nall of a sudden your right brain is has been a activated or otherwise I will have a very important\\n\\nmeeting that there is a lot of numbers and calculation and I need to focus. I can just close my left\\n\\nnostril and breathe with my right with breathing from my right nostril. I'm activating my left brain and\\n\\nI'm getting ready for dealing with numbers and um uh calculations. So it's a very uh effective\\n\\nprocess and we can do it very fast. Beautiful. I'm sorry. Is it beautiful? Yeah, thank you. And uh we\\n\\nare using this also for elderly that you heard some elderly they fall in uh one side, they fall on the\\n\\nright or they fall on the left several times. One of the reasons is because they have used one side of\\n\\nthe brain more than the other side. They have more weight on the that side. Just imagine average is\\n\\nabout if the person is 100 60 pounds, 16 pounds of that 10% of it is the head and when you're using\\n\\none side, so most of the weight because the blood is in there, more activity is blood in that side. So\\n\\nit's my head is heavier. So I'm falling that side. We are using this in adult day care centers to\\n\\nbalance both sides of the brain. So that way they balance their body. That's fantastic. Thank you so\\n\\nmuch for amazing tip and uh we're gonna have more tips to come. Thank you. Bye bye. Thank you.\"),\n",

You are a human being, you're gonna have\\n\\nemotions. Now imagine where the emotion is in your body. When you say I feel, where is it that\\n\\nyou're feeling that emotion? Um give it a number from zero which is nothing to 10, which is the\\n\\nhighest level of intensity. I imagine where the emotion is wherever it is. Put your hand on it. If it's\\n\\nyour chest, if it's your hands, if it's your head, if it's your shoulders, put your hands on it, close your\\n\\neyes and experience the emotion, the highest level of intensity, just put your focus in that area and\\n\\nsee what shape it has, what color it has and listen, listen carefully, what is it saying to you?

And for sure something outside of you have\\n\\ntriggered you. But also ask yourself, what is this emotion saying about me? How do I need to take\\n\\ncare of myself? Listen to that message. How do I need to take care of myself? Now, imagine\\n\\nyourself closing your eyes and with each breath taking in lightness and calmness into that area and\\n\\nexhaling whatever that intense emotion is that you don't want, I do this for a couple of minutes and\\n\\nthen also tell yourself what action you need to make.

I'm Doctor Fu J Zane and welcome to the inner voice show and this is the tip of the\\n\\nday and we have Eileen Manookian. Her expertise is in early childhood development and she is the\\n\\nfounder of gem edu Carere. She's with us to talk to you guys about your Children and how to have a\\n\\nquality time with them while they are home and uh how to entertain them and yourself at the same\\n\\ntime. Welcome to the show. Thank you, Doctor Zain and um hello everybody. We are gonna talk\\n\\nabout uh a little bit older Children between 6 to 12 years old. So Children at this age, they are at a\\n\\ndevelopmental stage that they want to do everything themselves. They get satisfied by completing,\\n\\ncompleting a ta a task. So the best thing to do is to give them some tasks to do. For example, you\\n\\ncan give them the task of putting the plates on the table, setting up the table for breakfast, for lunch,\\n\\nfor dinner. You can also have them help you with cleaning up the house. You can ask them one day\\n\\nto do the vacuuming the other day. You can ask them to do dusting, they really enjoy doing things\\n\\nand completing them. Um You can also create uh some kind of a um uh m match or game for them.\\n\\nIf you have more than one at home, more than one child, you can have a match of who cleans up\\n\\ntheir room the first or who cleans up each part of the house faster. You can do gardening with them,\\n\\nwhich is uh very uh appealing to kids this age. Uh If you have um uh potatoes at home, you don't\\n\\nneed to go out and get anything, just potatoes or onions, just put them in a, in a little bit of a damp\\n\\nplace and it will start growing and have them uh actually put it in the soil and be uh attentive to it,\\n\\nwater them every day, look out for them until it grows and becomes a plant. You can ask them to do\\n\\nprojects for the entire family. For example, you can ask them to put up a puppet shop. Um They can\\n\\nuse puppets if you have something like this at home. If you do not have puppets as them to create\\n\\nsock puppets from their own socks and they can use the sock puppet and talk uh while they are\\n\\ndoing the show. Uh If there, if this is very good project for even more than one kid at the house, you\\n\\ncan also video them and send it to their grandparents, their friends, their um aunts and uncles,\\n\\nwhoever you want. The other thing you can do is give them just a piece of item at home that you\\n\\ndon't use. For example, an empty uh box of tissues, give it to them and ask them to create anything\\n\\nthey want with it. Let them use their own creativity and come up with what they wanna create out of\\n\\nthis. Give them responsibilities of your pet. If you have a pet, give them responsibilities around the\\n\\nhouse that will help you out during the day or bake something with them, cook something with them.\\n\\nThey love these things. Uh I am not a big uh uh uh I'm not very crazy about kids sitting in front of the\\n\\ncomputer for a long time, but half an hour, 45 minutes for kids. This age in a day is not, is, is not a\\n\\nproblem. It's not, it's ok. You can go online. There are a lot of museums that are offering virtual\\n\\ntours. They can go on the museum and learn about things. You can have them learn uh on how to\\n\\nplay an instrument online, even how to sing or you can have them watch a performance that there\\n\\nare a lot of places that offer uh free performances online, even Broadway shows, they can watch\\n\\nsome of the Broadway shows for free. These are things that you can do with Children between in\\n\\nthe ages of 6 to 12 other than reading the books, which is very useful, drawing, painting, things like\\n\\nthat, that you already know, beautiful. I've also heard from a lot of my clients and friends, uh which\\n\\ntheir uh Children in that age have um a lot of energy to be able to release. And when they were\\n\\ngoing to school they had the gym time, they had, you know, running around time between the\\n\\nclasses and some of them are still being homeschooled right now and they're in contact with their\"),\n",

So there's a lot of bottled up energy that is not going\\n\\nanywhere. So it's in important for you guys to be able to, uh, walk around or run around, um,\\n\\noutside, maybe three times a day, uh, with your family and friends and then try to also bring them\\n\\nhome and at home if you can go out a lot and there's still a lot of excess, uh, energy. Uh, if they\\n\\ncan't, you know, walk the pet. But if at home, another thing you can do is to, uh, kind of like, um, put\\n\\ndown on the floor and they can hop on it and they can do UPS and, you know, kinda jumping up and\\n\\ndown, um, as if they're on a trampoline or there are small trampolines that you can get from your, for\\n\\nyour home and they can just do like a little bit of a jump up and down, nothing too much that they\\n\\nwould fall, but a little bit of a jump up and down in order to get this type of an energy out. And uh so\\n\\nthey can calm down because when you do don't do that, then it uh turns into agitation. And if you\\n\\nhave siblings in different ages, when one of them gets agitated, they usually go pick on the other\\n\\none and that's how they start a fight among all of them. And that usually turns into the parents\\n\\ngetting involved in the fight and the parents getting involved in the fight with each other. So this one\\n\\nway or another, not only you need to teach, uh not only entertain but also you're responsible to get\\n\\nthis energy out as soon as possible every day. Definitely, you can put some obstacles for them and\\n\\nhave them run around the obstacles or you can draw on the floor uh patterns on your driveway or uh\\n\\nin your backyard for them to jump on the patterns or run on the patterns. Uh And it will help them.\\n\\nUh You mentioned if they are at home and they don't have the opportunity to uh jump up and down,\\n\\nthey are on a higher level. One thing you can do is there are yoga classes online that are free for\\n\\nkids. You can use those and have them do yoga. It, it will help release that energy from their body\\n\\nwithout jumping too much often. That beautiful.

Thank you for asking those questions is that if I\\n\\nam shy, if I want to isolate, if I don't feel good in front of others, um If I really don't wanna be in social\\n\\ngroups, if I'm really anxious and even because of my anxiety, I feel depressed. What do I do? Is this\\n\\na condition? Did it get created from my childhood? Is this an illness? What is it? And what can I do?\\n\\nWell, there's a distinction between whether it's an illness or it is just a condition that you're going\\n\\nthrough. And I think part of the understanding of that is, is it stopping your life? Is it destroying your\\n\\nlife? Is it not allowing you to move forward? Is it just an inconvenience or it actually is destroying and\\n\\nstopping your life? So those are the ways to look at it. Some of the um ways that you could look at\\n\\nwhether you have generalized anxiety d disorder and you have high levels of anxiety or you might\\n\\ngo all the way to um mild depression uh or even um a chronic depression. Uh that is included with\\n\\nthe anxiety or that you might have antisocial personality disorder or um you know, there you might\\n\\nbe in the spectrum of um of uh the autism spectrum, so it could be any of that. So I would actually\\n\\nrecommend for you uh to go to your psychiatrist or psychologist or psychotherapist and uh get them\\n\\nto take some tests. So you have an understanding of whether everything that's going on in your life\\n\\nis considered an illness and what the treatment is for it. And uh what can you do to let go of that?\\n\\nUm Some of this could be genetic and you could see it if your family members, parents or\\n\\ngrandparents, uncles, aunts have um such as the same conditions that it could have been a genetic\\n\\ncomponent as it kind of moved forward and then um to you or that it's a behavioral where you've\\n\\nlearned it from your family because they were there and um they will be behaving the same way.\\n\\nThey would be um showing and behaving in an anxious way and the thought process and the\\n\\nlanguage they used, it showed more of anxiety or um or it was in a way that they were maybe\\n\\njudgmental and you felt shy and you felt like everybody was gonna judge you and you created a lot\\n\\nof anxiety for yourself or you wanted to isolate yourself in the room. Um Depending on how it is\\n\\nstopping you, uh to move forward. I think it's important. There are people who, um, it's ok for them to\\n\\nbe a loner. It's ok for them to isolate. It's, they don't need to really, really be out there and be with\\n\\npeople. Although, um, the social skills and the social upbringing, the social being a social human\\n\\nbeing, which we all are in a sense, it is important for you to also learn skills in how to be with public\\n\\nbecause you will need it for jobs, you will need it for getting jobs, you will need it for finding a mate,\\n\\num socializing the community. Um And that would hinder your growth. So even if we are talking\\n\\nabout people who are shy and who do have some social anxiety and they do have um isolated kind\\n\\nof personality. Um They could still learn skills that would hold them in a space in a safe way, such as\\n\\nfor example, skills of acting, many actors um play roles that uh they kind of dissociate from\\n\\nthemselves and play them very well in those roles and then they get off the role and they get off the\\n\\nstage and then go to who they are. So sometimes this is what we need to do. We need to learn the\\n\\nskills as an actor to be with public. The other side is that maybe working with a therapist, you will\\n\\nalso learn how to build a very deep connection for those relationships that you need such as\\n\\nmarriage or intimate relationship or having a best friend. You don't need to have hundreds of friends,\\n\\nbut it needs to have the skills of how to connect with one or two people where you can feel that\\n\\nthose people are great, great, um um have a closeness into your heart. Um And that might be\"),\n",

Um And that might be\\n\\nsufficient enough as far as the social anxiety. There are a lot of great, great skills that you can learn\\n\\nthrough hypnosis, through um actual doing them desensitization and learning how to be in a\\n\\nparticular way and keep doing it until you get a uh good at it. And then the shyness will go away or\\n\\nthe anxiety gets minimized. Obviously, um exercising and meditation brings down the anxiety,\\n\\nvisualization of who you will be when you do a task will start to get you ready in order to uh go into\\n\\npublic and perform and do whatever it is that you need to be among public, which would scare you.\\n\\nSo there are treatments for um anxiety, there are treatments for depression and there are definitely\\n\\ntreatments for um isolated or uh different types of personality disorders that would get you to be in\\n\\nthat space and there's definitely treatments for the spectrum of the autism spectrum. So um get\\n\\nhelp, you don't need to stay in anxiety. Uh There might be also med medication management that\\n\\nmight be medication therapy uh that would really support you. So take care of yourself. And if uh this\\n\\nis hindering your life, you need to get help, whether it's just a condition that you need to learn from,\\n\\nor it is actually a condition that is an illness and uh you need to take care of it.

Welcome to the voice show. I'm Doctor Fu J Zane and this is the tip of the day. We\\n\\nare here again with Eileen Manookian. She is an expert in early childhood development and the\\n\\nfounder of gem edu Carere. She is here with us to show you uh some different tasks and games\\n\\nthat you could play and uh create the learning for your Children while we're all at home and trying to\\n\\ncreate an amazing quality of time with our Children. So, welcome to the show. Thank you, Doctor\\n\\nZang. And uh hello, everybody. So today we are gonna talk about some um uh entertainment or\\n\\nsome toys that are appropriate for Children. Three years to five years old. The first thing you can do\\n\\nis you can get them some puzzles. This is a 24 piece puzzle that I uh purchased from a dollar store.\\n\\nIt's only $1 and it's very appropriate for a four or five year old. If you're uh trying to get it for a\\n\\nyounger one, for a three year old, get um little bit less pieces, maybe 12 piece or 16 pieces and then\\n\\nyou can gradually come to uh more pieces. Puzzle is very good because it's uh teaching Children\\n\\nhow to solve problems. It's very helpful for problem solving. And it also gives them the ability to think\\n\\ndifferently. They have to change and interchange the shape of the puzzle until they can figure out\\n\\nwhere to put it. It's very helpful for their brain development. Another toy that you can use is um\\n\\nsomething like this. This is different types of beads. Um And they are all different colors and different\\n\\nshapes. You don't necessarily have to have this. You can use anything that you have at home\\n\\ninstead of this. So what we do with this one is we give them one of his um clips and we ask them to\\n\\nhold the pieces one by one and put them in a certain cup. Now, this one has balls that have each\\n\\none has a different color. So we use the orange for orange beads. We use the pink for pink ones\\n\\nand then you can use different ways of playing with this. There are uh different uh uh pieces that are\\n\\nsquare, some are oval, some are uh uh circle. So you can teach them a lot with this one. It helps a\\n\\nlot with their uh control of their fingers. Uh They learn how to control the also pressure of the fingers,\\n\\nthe third toy or where do you find these toys? So these ones you can find online, you can go to\\n\\nAmazon and purchase it or you can go to uh later learning or Melissa and do a lot of places have\\n\\nthis. But if you don't have it, don't worry. Just use beans, use different colors of beans, different\\n\\nshapes of beans. You can use pinto beans, you can use uh black beans. You can use different\\n\\ntypes of beans and ask them to uh and, and find uh some anything that resembles this that they can\\n\\nput it uh pull it up and put it in the uh in the other tray, right? It's like an ice picker, an eye speaker or\\n\\neven if you have uh the Chinese uh uh uh sticks, you can put some uh rubber band on top and you\\n\\ncan create that one. The other toy that they can use that is very useful is buy some bean beets from\\n\\nany dollar store or if you have it at home, use yours. And uh this one is uh uh uh heart thinner. But\\n\\nyou can use anything you can use any thread that you can uh put it on. What they can create some\\n\\nbracelets. They can create anything that comes to their mind. This also helps with their uh motion of\\n\\nthe fingers and the control of the hand and they can learn uh size, they can learn color. Some of\\n\\nthem actually have alphabet on them. So for older ones, they can actually use the alphabet, put their\\n\\nown name on it or their parents names and siblings name on it and make them bracelets. So there's\\n\\na lot they can do from the younger to the older generation. Right. Yes. Exactly. Exactly.

I'm Doctor Fu Zane and I'm here with\\n\\nEileen Manukian. Her expertise is in early childhood development and she's the founder of GEM\\n\\nEducate. She's gonna let us know how we could support our kids at the time that we're all home so\\n\\nthey can learn something, we can entertain each other and we can have a spend like a quality time\\n\\nwith each other. Thank you for being here. This is Eileen Manukia. Welcome. Thank you, Doctor\\n\\nZhang. And uh hello, everybody. So we are gonna talk about uh a couple of crafts that you can do at\\n\\nhome with your kids um to help them entertain themselves and also to spend some quality time with\\n\\nthem. One of the things you can do if you're working and you need to spend time on your computer,\\n\\nget some coloring papers, you can get these books from a dollar store or you can print them. If you\\n\\nhave a printer at home, there are a lot of free ones online that you can go and print them. What you\\n\\ncan do is give this to your child but please give them one page at a time. Don't give them the whole\\n\\nbook because they're gonna, uh, just color every single page and then you won't have anything the\\n\\nnext day. Give them one page. Tell them, this is their job today. This is their responsibility. It's the\\n\\ngoal, uh, and color this the way that you can inside the lines and that's gonna be their project and\\n\\nyour project is to work on your computer or on the phone, whatever you're doing. And then at the\\n\\nend of the day, he needs to finish this or she needs to finish this while you're finishing your job. The\\n\\nother thing you can do is this one, they need your help. So find things that are lying around the\\n\\nhouse. For example, this is a paper plate and you can find uh we use buttons for the eyes and we\\n\\nhave the kids color the, the uh paper plate, have them color something, the paper plate or if you\\n\\ndon't have it just a circle, uh round uh piece of paper, have them do the ears the way you want. We\\n\\nchose to do like a part and then you can draw them out if the kid cannot, if the kid is able to have\\n\\nthem draw them up. And this part is you cut it from the paper and you uh stick it. If you need ideas\\n\\nfor this, there are tons of ideas online. You can still go online and put crafts for toddlers. Crats for\\n\\nfour year olds and it will give you a lot of ideas. These are things that keeps them busy. One other\\n\\none that is my favorite that kids love it and they uh entertain themselves for a long time is use the\\n\\nmiddle part of very valuable toilet papers and uh uh use two of them stick them together, either with\\n\\na stapler or with glue. Give it to them to color decorate, put stickers on depending on their abilities,\\n\\nwhatever they can do and then use them as binoculars. So they look and they use them as\\n\\nbinoculars. They love it. Kids enjoy this very much. They go on outside and they look for birds, they\\n\\ngo bird watching or they look for scrolls, you name it, they love it. If they are living in an apartment\\n\\nbuilding, you can have them watch it from the window and, and look for some stuff. This is one of\\n\\nthe things that the kids really, really enjoy. What are the age range uh for the task that you are\\n\\ntalking about it today. Um You can, kids can start doing this when they are about 2.5 years old. But I\\n\\nhave kids that are under two years old and they are able to do it. It all depends on the child's\\n\\nabilities. Every child is different. Parents normally know what their child is capable of doing. Um, you\\n\\ncan help them with whatever they are doing. But if you don't know their abilities, just test it, give it to\\n\\nthem and see how much they can do and if they can't do it, go to a simpler one, a more basic class.\\n\\nWonderful.

Welcome to the interview show. I'm Dr Fu Zane and this is the tip of the day. We\\n\\nare here with Eileen Manookian. She is an expert in early childhood development and the founder of\\n\\ngem edu care. She is with us to let you know how you could support your Children in learning\\n\\nalphabet and numbers while you are kind of doing homeschooling at in this times at home. Thank\\n\\nyou so much for being with us. Thank you, Doctor Zane and um thank you everyone for um\\n\\nwatching us. So today we are gonna talk uh about how to teach your Children the numbers and the\\n\\nletters, how to recognize the numbers and the letters. Um I personally uh think that the Children\\n\\nunder three years old are too young to recognize letters and numbers, but it's up to the parent. If you\\n\\nwant to, to start earlier. You can, what um I suggest you do is in the beginning of the week, choose\\n\\none letter and you don't have to go by the alphabet, not by the order you can do any letter you want.\\n\\nSo choose one letter, sorry, this is upside down and then do a craft with that letter. For example, this\\n\\nis E and A. Now if you want, if you need more ideas, you can Google it and you will find a lot of\\n\\nideas online. You can uh watch the Instagram of some people who do it. We even have some of\\n\\nthem on our Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest or even Google images. They'll give you do a lot of\\n\\nideas. So you make this in the beginning of the week, either the letter or the number and with the\\n\\nnumber, what we did is we put the number eight and we also have them count eight is and we put\\n\\neight is around number eight. Um You do one or the other, please do not mix them together or don't\\n\\ndo one letter and one number I in a week because it confuses the kids. So you do it in the beginning\\n\\nof the week and then during the week have them show you everything that starts with that letter.\\n\\nAnd then what you can do with a little bit older kids, four or five years old is give them any kind of\\n\\nmagazines you have, we all receive this in the mail. So there are a lot of magazines around the\\n\\nhouse that you're not using, ask them to show you whatever starts with that letter. And then if they\\n\\ncan have them cut it, if they cannot cut it, you cut it for them and then you can have them paste it on\\n\\na piece of paper and then they come up with a board, you put this board somewhere that they can\\n\\nsee for at least minimum of a week or maybe even more and don't make them wrong if they want.\\n\\nFor example, this was a board that our kids did for the letter B. You might think. Why is there an\\n\\narmchair? Armchair doesn't start with A B but it's black. The kid who found this said this is black\\n\\nand, and life starts with a B or the M and MS start with M. They don't start with B but to the kid they\\n\\nwere brown. So we don't make them wrong. We actually do whatever they think is uh starting with\\n\\nthat letter if it is correct. Uh And then please uh make sure that you're encouraging them and then\\n\\nput this in their room or wherever they can see on a daily basis and help them find other stuff that\\n\\nstarts with that letter. It's the best way of teaching your kid the alphabet or the numbers. Do you\\n\\nsuggest that first? They will go through the alphabet and then the numbers or is it OK to alternate\\n\\nduring the weeks? Also like one day they might um teach them a and the next week they might\\n\\nteach them one or should it be the whole alphabet before the numbers or all the numbers before the\\n\\nalphabet? Um I would suggest do one first and then finish it and then go to the, to the next one.\\n\\nBecause if you notice if the kids are younger, they are three years old or four years old. If you ask\\n\\nthem about, for example, what is this? If you don't ask them what number it is, they might tell you\\n\\nthis is B because it looks like b it confuses that. So it's better if you go through the alphabet, first\\n\\nfinish it and then go through the numbers, finish it, then go through the shapes, finish it, then go\"),\n",

Welcome back to the Inner Boys Show and this is the tip of the day with Eileen\\n\\nManookian. She is um an expert in early childhood development and she is the founder of GEM edu\\n\\ncare and you can find her at Gem educate.com. She's here again with us to show us what you could\\n\\ndo with things that you already have around the house to entertain you and your Children. Welcome\\n\\nto the show. Thank you, Doctor Zane and hello to everyone um who's watching us today. So we are\\n\\ngonna talk about some stuff that you can do with a little bit older kids. I would say around 18 months\\n\\nand up. Um You can try this with uh any age. Um not very young because very young kids are not\\n\\nable to do this. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna use again things that are useless in the\\n\\nhouse, but we can keep them and use them as crafts. This time, we are gonna use it as a craft tool.\\n\\nSo in the middle part of your uh paper towel or you can even use uh toilet paper, but toilet paper\\n\\nones are a little bit shorter, so it's more difficult to handle. The longer one are easier for the kids.\\n\\nYou just cut the top part of it into different, uh, strips. If the kid is three years or older, you can even\\n\\nhave them cut it, uh, with their, uh, scissors. And then you use it instead of a brush. You put some,\\n\\nuh, colors in a plate, paper plate. The color can be any type of color you have lying around the\\n\\nhouse. It could be um food coloring. It could be the colors you use with the kids or if you're a painter,\\n\\nyour own colors. So what they do is they use this as a brush, they put it in the uh colors and then\\n\\nthey put it on the paper, it creates different shapes. As you can see, it creates different shapes.\\n\\nEvery kid has a different creativity, they have different uh kind of abilities. So they will do whatever\\n\\nuh comes out of it. It, it looks like a uh uh kind of a Cubism. It doesn't come out as a picture, but it's\\n\\ninteresting. The other thing you can do is you can use a plastic fork, the plastic fork, they put it in the\\n\\ncolor and then they draw whatever they want with the plastic fork. You look here, I did it with my\\n\\nplastic fork with this. The kids use their creativity and they come up with something or you can guide\\n\\nthem what to do. Like this one is something that we did with them. We use the forks, the plastic\\n\\nforks, we had them create a face type of a thing. It's more oval than a, than a circle. And then we,\\n\\nwe did the, with the marker, we did the uh mouth of the bear and then we had them cut papers and\\n\\nput them as eyes and ears. They really enjoy doing stuff like this. And it's very interesting for them\\n\\nbecause they are not using a regular crayon or a marker. They are using something different. Um\\n\\nThey get fascinated with everything. Kids get uh uh entertained with everything. It might be boring\\n\\nfor you, but for the kids, they're not boring. So use your imagination or let them use their imagination\\n\\nand do whatever they want with it. I'm also assuming that they can take uh glasses bottles, different\\n\\ntypes that they have different shapes like round square or any of those and put the bottom in the\\n\\npaint and uh put it on the paper and create different types of shapes right after each other, right.\\n\\nThey could put paint on their hands and feet and put it on the paper. There's so many things that\\n\\nthey could do depending on what the age is, right? But so for a younger one, it will be sophisticated\\n\\nas it, as they grow older, they'll come up with more sophisticated uh creativity with what they can\\n\\nfind around. The house definitely. And uh for you, uh it's easier if you let them come up with the\\n\\ncreativity rather than you do because uh my experience is as adults, we have forgotten how to be\\n\\ncreative, but the kids have that ability is still to be creative. So let them go and explore and tell you\\n\\nwhat they want to do. Sometimes it's not possible but sometimes it's, it's usable. You can even use\"),\n",

Just watch out for the rest of your furniture. So make sure that this is\\n\\nhappening in a closed environment. Um and then it's brought up with the papers and put in the\\n\\naround the house.

I'm Doctor Fu Jianze and welcome to the inter interview show. And here we are with\\n\\nanother tip of the day and we are here with Eileen Manua. She is an early childhood development\\n\\nspecialist and the founder of gem edu Carere. She is here with us today to show us with everything\\n\\nyou already have at home. How you're going to entertain your Children and on this one pretty much\\n\\nentertain yourself and become a baby and watch. Thank you. Thank you for being with us. Sure.\\n\\nHello, Doctor Zain and hello everybody. So today we're gonna try to use some uh stuff that are lying\\n\\naround the house and you're not using them. So we're gonna use plastic bottles. It doesn't matter\\n\\nwhat shape, which size doesn't really matter whatever you have around the house, use that. So\\n\\nwhat we're gonna do is we're gonna use some uh stuff that will make noise. We're gonna, I, I am\\n\\nusing uh beans, red beans and I'm using some uh coins that are useless. Um I don't use them\\n\\nanywhere. They are pennies or uh quarters or whatever you have around the house. So we're\\n\\ngonna open the bottle and we are gonna put the whatever beans for, for me, it's the beans, the\\n\\nbeans inside the bottle. What you can do with young kids is you can ask them to put the beans\\n\\ninside the bottle one by one that's gonna take a long time for them to do and they're gonna still enjoy\\n\\nit. Then they're gonna close the bottle. We're gonna ask them to decorate the bottle. Now, remove\\n\\nthe sticker of the bottle and have them either write something, draw something with a marker, put\\n\\nstickers on it, whatever you have around the house. You don't need to go out and get stuff for them\\n\\nto do that. It's very simple. They can do whatever they want with the bottle. And then the other one I\\n\\nalready prepared this because it's making too much noise. When I am trying to put the coins in, I put\\n\\ncoins in this bottle. The shape of the bottle is a little bit more interesting. And then you can have\\n\\nagain, uh the kid uh decorate the bottle and then we are gonna use them as musical instruments so\\n\\nthey can look and this one so they can use them as musical instruments. Kids really love this\\n\\nbecause it entertains them. It helps them with their listening skills, especially when they want to\\n\\nlearn music. If you want your kid to learn music in the first three years of their life, they cannot learn\\n\\nmusic, they only learn beats and they can learn the beats like this. For example, you do the\\n\\npopcorn, pop the popcorn and they will follow the beats. They will start doing that with the music that\\n\\nthey hear at home. And they really enjoy this. When we did this, uh at my place, the kids wanted to\\n\\nplay with this all day long, every single day until we actually got rid of them because we couldn't\\n\\nhandle them. Um playing with this all day long, they really enjoy it and they like it and it doesn't\\n\\nmean anything. You're just doing the, creating something out of some stuff at home that you're not\\n\\nusing. I was thinking um that for people who have a lot of little Children at home and they're already,\\n\\nit's like it feels like a noise pollution. If you don't want these hard ones, maybe use rice in there or\\n\\nmaybe use even water and different types of water. So you could have a different, like a lower one\\n\\nor the accumulation of different one and you're gonna have a band actually on your hand and do it.\\n\\nUm And you can see what um Mrs um Manookian has done with her daycare at go to GEM edu\\n\\ncare.com. If you need more information about what she does with her day daycare, which is\\n\\nawesome and we'll talk about that later. So don't go anywhere. We have more of these type of um\\n\\nuh tips that she's gonna show you with uh your creation with everything that's around the house. So\\n\\nthank you for being with us. Bye bye.\"),\n",

Welcome to the tip of the day again and we are here with Eileen Manookian. She's\\n\\nan expert in your kids and she is the founder of GEM Educate. She's here with us to let us know\\n\\nwhat you could do with things you have around the house or you may buy to entertain your little\\n\\nChildren and probably yourself at this time. Welcome to the show. Thank you, Doctor Zane. Uh And\\n\\nuh hello to everybody. Uh So today we're gonna talk about how to entertain uh different ages of\\n\\nkids. Th this specific thing that I have today for you is very, very simple and you can entertain kids\\n\\nfrom nine months old, a year old, up to six year old. Everybody likes it. Everybody uses it in a\\n\\ndifferent way. So what I have here is I have empty tissue boxes. As you can see, I keep everything\\n\\nthat lies around the house that is empty because later on we use them um for creativity. So what we\\n\\ndo is we use them as blocks for the kids. You give it to the kids and you let them use their own\\n\\ncreativity to build something So when they are younger, what they do is they only build, they only uh\\n\\nstack them up each other and then after it's stacked up, what gives them the most fun is to kick it\\n\\nand drop everything on the, on the table. So I'm not gonna kick it because it makes too much noise.\\n\\nAnd then, um, but then they get a little bit older. If they are three or four years old, they use their\\n\\ncreativity to build a castle to create a bridge. Sometimes they, if they are boys, they build something\\n\\nand they call it a garage. They put their, their uh cars underneath the girls make beds and put their\\n\\ndolls on it. So they use their creativity with this. The simplest thing that you can find around your\\n\\nhouse, you can use any kind of box. It doesn't have to necessarily be tissue boxes. These are just\\n\\nsomething that is available at everybody's house. You can use your uh delivery boxes, which\\n\\nnowadays we all have a lot of them at home and give it to your kids uh to play with them if you want\\n\\nto buy a toy for your kid and you're looking into buying something that is useful and they will play for\\n\\na long time with it. You can buy blocks for them. These blocks are made of foam. This specific type\\n\\nthat I'm uh showing you, there are blocks that are made of wood or you can buy lego blocks for\\n\\nthem. And uh the same thing, they do the same thing with this. They stack them up each other.\\n\\nThey learn the colors, of course, because these are colorful, they stack them up each other. They\\n\\nstart building stuff as they grow older and older. This is one thing that they can use for a six month\\n\\nold and you can use for a six years old. So, uh it's uh very useful and it's very easy to do. Now tell\\n\\nme the dis distinct difference of what a six month old to a year old might do with these versus a six\\n\\nyear old. So I know there's, this is a huge, huge gap. But when we say one toy can be used for this\\n\\nand that, what is it that they're gonna learn at each stage with the same toy? So the six months old\\n\\nis only trying to figure out what to do with the box. The six month old is only putting it down and he's\\n\\ntrying to put the other one next to this one or on top of it and sometimes it falls. So they learn how to\\n\\nput it correctly to actually hold it. And also they are using of course their hands. So it's their sensory\\n\\nmotor skills. A six year old is not doing that anymore. A six year old is using his or her imagination of\\n\\nbuilding something out of with boxes. For example, if I'm gonna build a uh bridge for you like this\\n\\nand then I can put my cars underneath here. Then I am building something uh they use their\\n\\ncreativity of creating something that is age appropriate for them. You don't need to do anything, they\\n\\ndo it themselves. You don't need to guide them. It's just for you to know what they're doing with it\\n\\nand what it means. Sometimes they might, if it is a tissue uh box, the six year old might come up\"),\n",

Sometimes they might, if it is a tissue uh box, the six year old might come up\\n\\nwith an idea of putting something on inside and then put this on top. So they will have something\\n\\ncoming out of here. Maybe it's a flower, maybe it's a tree, whatever they are coming up with. I think\\n\\nthe more uh most important point is for uh the parents to know that different items that you have\\n\\naround the house. If you also look at them as a possible toy and you allow your Children or bring it\\n\\ninto their area and even call it a toy or say that let's have a project with us, then suddenly your\\n\\nChildren will start using them and their creativity as uh as a toy. So this starts with your um invention\\n\\nof toys around the, from the things you have around the house. First in your own vision, when you\\n\\ncreate that, then suddenly your Children will take that project from you. Bring their own creativity in it\\n\\nand watch. Well, we've got new toys coming out of your house and a long hours of them really\\n\\nentertaining themselves. Thank you, uh, Eileen Manookian and for all of you, we still have more\\n\\npoints coming and uh, a lot more toys that she's gonna show us. So stay tuned for more of these,\\n\\nuh, tip of today.

Are you having trouble sleeping? So let's look\\n\\nat some um hygiene for your sleeping. First of all, the place has to be dark and cool. A temperature\\n\\nthat feels comfortable and cool for you. And when you put all the lights out, it really has to be out\\n\\nand dark now for about an hour before you sleep, please stop working with your computer, your\\n\\niphone, uh your uh anything, anything that needs to be interactive between you and uh the computer\\n\\nyou can watch TV, from far if you're watching um, a show that is comedy, uh light drama, which is\\n\\ngonna be light and fun.

They have sleep music with by normal beat that are amazing and\\n\\nthey're there for eight hours. You can write down whatever it is that is in your thought before you\\n\\nsleep and just jot it down, jot it down, whatever it is, get it out and put it aside. Maybe you could read\\n\\nbefore you sleep. Not on your computer but actual book or magazine and something that you can\\n\\nopen and read and, and get entertained by nothing that kind of like gets your emotions the negative\\n\\nemotions or Adri up because that's not what you wanna do before you sleep. Don't eat before you\\n\\nsleep, maybe a couple of hours before, take care of yourself because you do need minimum about 7\\n\\nto 8 hours of sleep and for students probably around 9 to 10 hours. So take care of yourself. And\\n\\nthis has been the tip of the day.\"),\n",

Welcome to the show and I am Doctor Fu Sin and looking forward to speaking with\\n\\nEileen Manookian. She is an expert in child development and uh she's the founder of um geometric\\n\\nCare. And she's here to let you know with simple uh toys, how you can entertain your little kids for a\\n\\nlong time and teach them in the meanwhile. So, welcome to the show. Thank you, Doctor Zane. And\\n\\nhello everybody today we are gonna talk about toys that are uh more educational for your little ones\\n\\nand that they can use uh uh for a longer time. So I'm gonna tell you how to choose a toy. The first\\n\\ntoy that I have here for you is this little hedgehog. Um I really like this toy for younger kids between\\n\\nthe ages of nine months, 89 months, up to two years old because it does several things for them. It\\n\\nhelps them with their fine motor skills. They first learn how to pull out these pieces and then they\\n\\nlearn how to put it in, they learn how to manage and control their fingers and the force that they are\\n\\nputting on these uh pieces. Second thing is that they are different colors. So they learn the colors,\\n\\nyou can ask them to put each color in a row or you can ask them to give you the green color, the red\\n\\ncolor. When you're playing with them, you teach them the colors in the beginning, they learn only to\\n\\nknow that this color is different from this one. And then later on, they learn this one is green. This\\n\\none is red when you talk to them and you explain the names of the colors. Um If you pay attention,\\n\\nthere are also numbers written next to each hole, then later on, you can also teach them the\\n\\nnumbers, put it in. Number one, put it in number two. So this is a toy that they will play and learn\\n\\nfrom it for a very long time. So this is one of the toys that I would highly suggest, not necessarily\\n\\nexactly the same thing, but something that teaches them two or three things at the same time. This\\n\\none is a puzzle toy. So these puzzles are good for younger kids again because they are exercising\\n\\ntheir fine motor skills with their hands. The good thing about this one is when they are holding this\\n\\npiece, they are actually using their fingers in exact same way that in the future, they're gonna hold\\n\\ntheir pens or pencils. So we are helping them manage their, the way they are using their fingers. For\\n\\nthe future writing skills. It also helps them to match the picture of the animal and the color of it. And\\n\\nyou see, I am doing it very easily. But if you give this to a nine month old or a, a year old or an 18\\n\\nmonth old, they have difficulty putting it in. So they learn how to uh put something inside a space\\n\\nthat belongs to it. And they also use their eye hand co ordination. They use their fine motor skills\\n\\nand they learn the colors and the shapes and the names of the animals. So this is another toy that is\\n\\nvery useful and they play for a long time and they learn a lot from it. Um uh Where can people find\\n\\nthese types of toys? Is it easily available in um like 99 cent stores or toy stores or are there? Uh\\n\\nespecially since they can't go out right now. Where is it that they can get it online? Um I'm pretty\\n\\nsure that Amazon has a lot of these toys, but the two companies that are really good, sorry that I\\n\\nreally like. And they have educational tours. One of them is Melissa and do, uh Amazon has Melissa\\n\\nand do dollar stores don't have them. But there are a lot of stores that you can find these products in\\n\\nthem. There are, and uh the other one is Lakeshore Learning. You can go to Lakeshore\\n\\nlearning.com and buy the stuff from there. They have all these sales, they have 50% sales, they\\n\\nhave different types of sales items. Um And this one is from Lakeshore Learning. Lakeshore\\n\\nLearning is the sites that most of the uh teachers use because they have a lot of educational choice.\\n\\nIt's really great because you can uh uh they have the gender specific toys.

I'm Dr Fu Jz and welcome to the Inner voices show. We have another show with uh\\n\\nEileen Manukian. She's an expert in your little Children and she is the founder of gem edu Carere.\\n\\nEileen is with us to give you some tips with everything you actually have at home and how to\\n\\nentertain your little one. So, welcome to the show, Eileen. Thank you, Doctor Zane and hello,\\n\\neverybody. So today we are gonna talk about something that is very, very easy to do, but you can\\n\\nentertain your little ones. You can even start from six months old babies up to three or four years old\\n\\nwith this one. So what I did is I found some uh cups around the house, different sizes of cups. The\\n\\npoint of this game for them is to learn the sizes. So it's more geometry that we are teaching them.\\n\\nIt's very, very basic, but they are also learning it. So they are learning that this one, the little one will\\n\\nfit into this one, but the opposite is not possible. I cannot fit the the bigger one inside the little one.\\n\\nThis is not gonna happen by telling them this is gonna happen by them experimenting it. So give\\n\\nthem some different types of, uh, cups, different sizes, different shapes, whatever you have around\\n\\nthe house is fine and let them play with it. You can play different things. You can put them on top of\\n\\neach other, you can put them inside each other. They're gonna learn how to do all these things on\\n\\ntheir own. I'm trying to get everything, um, on the camera. So what they're gonna do is they're gonna\\n\\njust enjoy playing with the cups and you're gonna use this opportunity to teach them the colors. If\\n\\nyou have different color cups, if you don't have different color cups, don't worry about it. This is just\\n\\nan extra bonus. So you teach them, this is yellow. Do you want to put the yellow cup inside the blue\\n\\ncup or you want to put the blue cup inside the yellow cup? You're teaching them inside and you're\\n\\nteaching them the colors. Um, so what, um, you can do with this is you can ask them to bring you a\\n\\ncertain color and put another color inside that color or the bigger one, the smaller one, the medium,\\n\\none, bigger, biggest, big, uh, uh, smaller, smaller, smaller, smallest, uh, you can teach all of this in\\n\\njust by playing with these cups. Another thing you can do after they learn the colors and after they\\n\\nplay with it is you can put, this is the, the funnest part for them. Put one small one, put a medium\\n\\nsize on top and put the, the biggest size on top. Tell them to close their eyes when you're doing this.\\n\\nAnd then I ask them, where, where are the other two cups? What happened to them? Where is the\\n\\nsmall one? And the medium one? And they love finding it. They're gonna look around, they're gonna\\n\\nlook inside the other cups and then finally they're gonna find it. It's in, uh, under the big cup. Um, the\\n\\nother thing you can do to teach them the colors is just cut whatever color you're teaching them. If\\n\\nyou have the paper on that color, cut the paper. If you don't have it color, it just get a white paper\\n\\nand color it. So this is a blue piece of paper. We put blue with the, uh, with stickers, you can write it\\n\\ndown for them. Make sure you're writing the name of the, the color because it helps them memorize\\n\\nit and their eye sees it a lot. They know what, what this says is blue and then tell them this is blue,\\n\\nfind some blue stuff that you have around the house and stick it on the paper and then put this in\\n\\ntheir room or wherever they play the place that they see it more often than any. You do this every\\n\\nweek, you only focus on one color, each week. Don't do it every day because it's too much. And\\n\\nthen what you can do is you can ask them, they will, they will do this automatically, but you can even\\n\\nask them, go and find three items that are blue in the house and bring it. Uh, and every day remind\\n\\nthem, what was the color of the wall? What is the color of the paper that way they learn that color\"),\n",

What is the color of the paper that way they learn that color\\n\\nand then the next week go to another color. Um, that's how you can teach them the colors and you\\n\\ncan make it fun for them. And it seems like if you actually, um, work with one color and you put that\\n\\nin their play area or their bedroom, um, in the whole week, they will also do a scavenger hunt around\\n\\nthe house finding the color for you. And if they can't, you can guide them to do that if you go around\\n\\nthe house and say, let's find blue. And, um, so the whole week they'll be looking for blue and you\\n\\ncan also put blue everywhere, like things that, you know, particularly and put them around the house\\n\\nso they can find it and they get excited about finding them and letting the letting you know how great\\n\\nthey are that they know it. So, thank you so much Eileen Manukian. And for all of you, wait, we still\\n\\nhave much more every day with what Eileen is gonna show us in what to do with your Children.\\n\\nThank you.

Welcome to the Inner Boys Show and I'm Doctor Fu John Zane and I'm excited to\\n\\nhave Eileen Manukian. She's a child specialist and the founder of gem edu care with us. And she's\\n\\ngonna show you all these wonderful ways in finding the things that are around your house or in the\\n\\nnear supermarkets and bring them to your home and entertain your little ones. And that is so\\n\\nimportant since everybody is kind of cooped up at this point. So welcome to the show. Uh Hello,\\n\\nDoctor Zane. Thank you and uh hi everyone. Um so I'm gonna try to help you as much as I can to\\n\\num entertain your little ones with everything that you have lying around the house. So you don't\\n\\nhave to go out and uh buy anything. So today we're gonna use our empty tissue boxes, which is this\\n\\none or you can use any box that you have? Use your imagination. You don't have to exactly do what\\n\\nI have done. These are the things that I had around the house. So I use them an empty tissue box\\n\\nthen use uh any kind of um I want to say a huge toothpick. This is a screw but you can use anything\\n\\nthat um is looks like this. It's, it's safe for the kids. So we put them inside the empty tissue box and\\n\\nthen they are gonna use several different types of straws, different colors. So what I did is I cut all\\n\\nthe straws into smaller pieces. You can use as many as you want, depending on the age of the kid.\\n\\nThis is good for Children between nine months old to three years old. So use whatever color you\\n\\nhave at home. What we do is we are gonna ask them to color coordinate and put each color of the\\n\\nstraw in one of these screws. So this is the white one. I'm gonna put it in the, in one of them and\\n\\nthen I have the green one in the other one. I would suggest you do the first one for them. So they\\n\\nknow how to do it. This helps with their sensory motor skills. It helps them with using their being\\n\\ngentle, using their fine motor skills on their fingers. It helps them with how to hold it, which eventually\\n\\nis gonna help them how to hold their pencils or pens. Um And it also teaches them the colors in the\\n\\nbeginning when they are very little. We only want them to know that color green is different than\\n\\ncolor red. We don't want them to necessarily name them. But then later when they are getting older,\\n\\nbut you name them because then they, that's how they learn from you. That's one thing they can do\\n\\nwhen they're done putting everything in. Now, you can ask them to take them out and put them in a\\n\\nbowl or you can ask them to color, coordinate it in different, uh, uh, little plates or bowls, whatever\\n\\nyou have at home. And then the next time you can ask them to color, coordinate them differently or\\n\\nuse their imagination. If they wanna put one blue, one red, one green, they can do that with this.\\n\\nYou can entertain them for a very long time. You can use your own creativity and come up with\\n\\ndifferent things that they can do. Also don't forget small kids, young kids love consistency. They\\n\\ndon't get bored. You think they get bored? But they don't, if you have them play with this for two or\\n\\nthree hours, they will do that. If they get tired to remove it and give it to them in the afternoon,\\n\\nremove it and give it to them in the next morning. They love when they, uh, know how to do\\n\\nsomething they want to master the skill. So let them play with the effort as long as they want. And\\n\\nthe beauty with this is that each time you give it to them, they have the, the little ones have the\\n\\nchoice to do exactly what they did before or they can do another game exactly with what you have\\n\\nuh because of the color coordinate, because of the naming and everything can be done in such a\\n\\nvariety of way just with three pieces uh that you already have at home or you can get it from any of\\n\\nyour supermarkets near you. So thank you so much and stay tuned for more tips with Eileen\\n\\nManookian. Bye bye. Thanks.\"),\n",

Thank you so much for sending your questions. One of the questions\\n\\nthat I got is why do we sabotage ourselves? How come that we set up a goal? We really want this.\\n\\nWe make effort. We go on and get it and then zip hold it, don't go further in it and we start\\n\\nsabotaging ourselves. And it's like what happened if I didn't want it? Why did I make such an effort\\n\\nto create it? And I've seen this with people who have gone and put themselves into a school and\\n\\neducation and they came out with $200,000 of or more of a loan and then yet, uh they get their\\n\\ndegrees, they get their licenses and then, uh, they sabotage it one way or another. They're not\\n\\npursuing it. They won't go in it. They'll just say I didn't want to anymore or they do something within\\n\\nthat profession that their licenses are taken away. And um, their career is pretty much shot. I've\\n\\nknown people who wanted to be married and have Children and create a family and that was their\\n\\nbiggest goal and they got it all, finally they were, you know, got married with the, with the mate that\\n\\nthey really wanted and all is well, and then they begin sabotaging it by their anger and, you know,\\n\\nsense of entitlement and constantly fighting within that system of the marriage. And finally there's\\n\\ndivorce papers are there and they're like, I don't, just don't want to be with you anymore. So you\\n\\ncould see where people really want something and they do so much to get it and then ruin it\\n\\nimmediately. Well, there appear, appears to be uh some type of a duality where although one part of\\n\\nus wants something and wants the success and makes the effort. Another part has a different belief\\n\\nsystem. Maybe it has a different belief system and I don't deserve this or it should be another way or\\n\\nuh I don't even know who I am in this space where I know who I was without it and then I wanted it.\\n\\nBut then now that I'm here, I have no idea who I am. And then the same type of anxieties of not\\n\\nknowing the uncertainty of the new way of being might trigger a lot of the wrong coping mechanisms\\n\\nor the way that I used to deal with. Uh in order to go back, I've known people who wanted to be a\\n\\ncertain way. They've worked so hard to get to that weight and then they didn't know who they were. I\\n\\nlost 50 pounds, 60 pounds started getting people to look at them and pay attention to them and they\\n\\nwere so uncomfortable with this attention that they started eating again and gained the weight back.\\n\\nSo it's almost like there's a wish that we want and then we get the wish, but we have no idea who\\n\\nwe are. So it's important to build a new identity with this new wish and sometimes we'll get the wish\\n\\nand then we're trying to build the identity as it shows up. And it's scary for us. So role modeling after\\n\\npeople who are in that position, looking at the that they've created and then integrating it into our\\n\\nsystem about who I am today. As I've gained the new relationship, as I've gained the success, the\\n\\nsuccess of the new business of the new uh body image that I have of the new wealth that I've\\n\\nacquired all of that in that way, I can create my new identity, which is a combination of what I was\\n\\nbefore and who I was before. And some of those behaviors with the combination of a new set of\\n\\nbehavior that creates success in the new concept. So if a part of me sabotage me is because it\\n\\nhasn't been upgraded to this level and it's still operating at some old level that was there, whether I\\n\\nthought I didn't deserve it, whether I thought I wasn't good enough for it, whether I thought I'm\\n\\nscared and won't be able to survive this or whether I thought I got it, but it's not something that I\\n\\nwanted to have. Um So all of those are the different types of belief systems that if I don't attend to it\\n\\nsubconsciously are gonna come in and take away everything that I just built. So the awareness of all\\n\\nof these different parts that are coming together and how each one of them may have a different\"),\n",

So the awareness of all\\n\\nof these different parts that are coming together and how each one of them may have a different\\n\\nneed and comes together and those needs have to be taken care of and negotiated for me to be in\\n\\na new business in a new way of a socio-economic class, in a new way of a body image that I have in\\n\\nnew, in relationships that I want to be in, in a new way of vulnerability in a new way of success. All of\\n\\nthose are new ways of being when we have an image of creation of something, we only have the\\n\\nimage of what the create, you know, what the outcome would look like. We might not have the vision\\n\\nof who would I be as that outcome shows up and would I be comfortable with it or not? And\\n\\nsometimes we won't know all of it until we're there. So sometimes it's on the job training where I\\n\\nhave to start integrating those uh places, most people, if they're not watching all other areas, all the\\n\\ninner voices that are telling them what I want and what I don't want and ignore them, deny them,\\n\\navoid them, those inner voices. If they're not taken care of, they'll come in and we'll pay you the\\n\\nconsequences. So watching, hearing, honoring yourself in all of those aspects will make, you know,\\n\\nwill be in a way that you will be able to negotiate, give those parts of you the things they want and\\n\\nthen integrate the two new system that you've worked so hard to get.

Welcome to the voice show. I'm Doctor Fu Zane and I'm excited to be with Eileen\\n\\nManookian. Um, she's a childcare specialist and she is the founder of gem edu care. Um We know\\n\\nthat a lot of you are kind of cooped up with your little ones at home and you probably are running out\\n\\nof um air, you know, things to do with them and not necessarily knowing how to get creative. Well,\\n\\nEileen is here to let us know and give us tips on different types of things that you might have around\\n\\nthe house and how you can use them to entertain yourself and the little ones. So, welcome to the\\n\\nshow, Eileen Manukia. Hello, Doctor Zain and uh hello to everybody who's uh seeing us now. Um\\n\\nSo, um I am, as Doctor Zin said, uh I work with little kids and um, I know how difficult it is to entertain\\n\\nthem. We are gonna try to keep it as simple as possible for you to know what to do at home. So you\\n\\ndon't have to go out in this uh stay at home situation to buy stuff you can use whatever you have at\\n\\nhome, but entertain your little ones. The first thing that they're gonna do is use a cake mixer and use\\n\\num, you can use cotton balls or you can use balls like this. These are available on all of the dollar\\n\\nstores. You can even order them online. One big bag is a dollar. So it's really not expensive. You put\\n\\nall these little balls or your cotton balls inside the cake mixer and you give the cake mixer to your\\n\\nlittle one. This is good for kids between the ages of six and 18 months old. Um They love the um\\n\\naction of pulling something out of something. If you notice they are really, really enjoying pulling out\\n\\nall the tissues from the tissue box, making your life a complete mess. That's why they like it because\\n\\nthey are pulling something out of something. So they will be busy with this for a long time. You can\\n\\neven give them a B to put the all the little balls in the bowl and then you can give it to them back\\n\\nagain in a few hours or the next day. Kids love repetition. They are, you actually can use the same\\n\\ntoy with them for a few times. They love consistency. They don't get tired of it. So please reuse it\\n\\nevery day. This is also helping their sensory motor skills. Um They um touch two different types of\\n\\nsurfaces and they are uh they are using their little fingers, their, uh, uh, fine motor skills to pull this\\n\\nout. So, it's a very good exercise for very young Children. It's wonderful to take things that are from\\n\\nour own home and don't even have to go spend time, um, outside or, uh, spend money outside. Um,\\n\\nyou can use things that are in your own kitchen and, uh, create toys for your, uh, little ones. Well,\\n\\nthank you so much and, um, uh, stay tuned.

If you are living with someone who's just\\n\\npanicking and freaking out based on all the news that's happening around the Coronavirus, we can\\n\\nhelp. You really can instead of being upset with them and uh being nasty to them just to calm them\\n\\ndown. Like I don't wanna deal with you. Maybe you do need to deal with them since you're living\\n\\ntogether. Right? And if you don't deal with it, they're just gonna panic more. So maybe you could let\\n\\nthem know and the way that you can calm them, some people get calmed down by knowing facts.\\n\\nRight? So, for those people, you definitely should let them know about the reality of the facts and\\n\\nyour facts, not just what's going on around the world, but what's going on with you? Like we're ok,\\n\\nwe're all still here. We don't have the virus or even if we do, we're, you know, ok, at this point, we're\\n\\ndoing everything that we can. So you let them know about the reality check of the present if they're\\n\\nnot that tight and they really need you to handle their emotion, then please do that first. It would be\\n\\nsomething like, you know, it's all normal. It's ok. It's ok that you're afraid it's ok that you're getting\\n\\nangry and frustrated if this is normal emotions that we all have. I sometimes have that. And how can\\n\\nI support you to calm down? What do you need from me emotionally in order to know that I'm here\\n\\nfor you. We're all gonna get through this together if there a belief. Um, and in a spiritual belief, a\\n\\nreligious belief that you can kind of like hang on to bring that in and, you know, meditate together,\\n\\npray together and do all of the emotional aspects so that you could calm yourself down. And then\\n\\nafter you calm yourself down and then the person, um, uh, emotionally, then you can go back into\\n\\nthe reality checkup. This is what our reality is today at our own home. This is how we're taking care\\n\\nof each other and ourselves. And, you know, we're gonna do the best that we can and, um, look at\\n\\nwhat it is that you can do in reality and not worry about things that are out of your control at this\\n\\npoint.

I'm Doctor Fu Jian Zane and I just wanted to share with you, uh, some of the\\n\\nconversations that I've had with, uh, people around me, whether they were friends or colleagues or\\n\\nclients.

Uh, they're out of work at\\n\\nthis point or they're going to school and the school is having everything online and they are not\\n\\ngoing out with their friends and they're not dating and they're just bored at home. So we've been\\n\\ntalking about, well, what you do when you're single and you want it to today and this is not a good\\n\\ntime. Some people are like, oh, nothing's gonna happen to me but it's showing in Italy that a lot of\\n\\nyoung people aren't getting infected by Coronavirus. So it might happen to you also. Many of you\\n\\nmight have, um, family and friends in home or uh elderly parents or grandparents at home that you\\n\\nneed to be a bit careful about this one. You don't wanna get infected too. You don't wanna be the\\n\\none who's infecting other people going back to dating. What should we do. Well, how about\\n\\nbeginning to do Zoom or Skype or facetime Dating? I know some of you are like, well, I don't know,\\n\\nbut you've been chatting a lot over a lot of the, um, websites. So beyond the chat, why don't you\\n\\ninstead of meeting them outside first start meeting them on Skype or Zoom or facetime or any video\\n\\nchat that you, you actually like and get to know each other converse for um the next two weeks or\\n\\nthree weeks or four weeks. And uh get to know each other before visually, before you actually get to\\n\\nsee each other and uh get to go out. So why not try that? And then you're bored. Listen, look at all\\n\\nthe things you ever wanted to do and you didn't have time, maybe write um um whatever shows up\\n\\nfor you like a journaling and maybe they'll turn into a screenplay or a book or a movie or something.\\n\\nOr maybe you could create these video blogs and share what's going on with you and your\\n\\nboredom. Maybe start meditating and looking at what's really going inside, connect with your friends\\n\\nthrough uh normally through the social media and text and messaging, but also face to face through\\n\\nthese video conferencing and um go walk, nobody's telling you not to go walk, uh just do it alone, go\\n\\nwalk outside, go run. I know you guys can't go to the gym, but at least you can run and jog on your\\n\\nown. Take care of yourself. Hang in there. We'll all get out of this soon. I know it.

I know that everyone's going through a lot\\n\\nof anxiety due to the Coronavirus. So the first thing we gotta do is calm down. We're gonna allow\\n\\nourselves to calm down. And the best way to begin, calming down is really focusing inward and\\n\\nfocusing on your breathing. So this is what I want you to do with me. If you're driving, don't close\\n\\nyour eyes if you were at home or anywhere else. If you beside driving, I want you to close your eyes\\n\\nand begin concentrating on your breathing, put your hands on your stomach and allow the bottom of\\n\\nyour stomach to come up as you inhale. And then I also just want you to concentrate on exhaling.\\n\\nThat's all I want you to do. So, inhale 12345 and exhale 123456789, 1011 1213, as much as you\\n\\ncan. And that's all that I want you to concentrate on your breathing and concentrate on your exhaling\\n\\nand everything else will fall into place to calm you down.

I see\\n\\nthis a lot with couples where um they, each one of them believes a particular way of um doing\\n\\nsomething and um they will defend it to death and they will tell each other that their way is right. And\\n\\num it is hard for them to negotiate and come to see that some other way may also be OK for them.\\n\\nI've also had the experience of people coming to me hiring me wanting to hear um how I can show\\n\\nthem and to have some skills. But even as I say, the skills that they will resist it and they don't want\\n\\nto hear it. It's very dear to them the way they are doing something, although it's not working for them\\n\\nthat it needs to be um handled with care and not just negated. So how do we handle that? One of\\n\\nthe things that I've noticed is in front of other people becoming righteous, maybe we also become\\n\\nrighteous, maybe we take on the same kind of mirroring and then it's two people who've become\\n\\nrighteous. It's as if if the other person puts their foot down and says that's just the way it is, maybe\\n\\nour way of protection is also just to say, oh, yeah, it's my way also. And this is the way it is. Or if I\\n\\ngive in to yours because there's no other way, then I would be losing power or losing the game or I\\n\\nwould feel inferior. So, what I've noticed, especially with long term relationships, such as marriages,\\n\\nworking together, family members, good friends who really enjoy each other's relationship and want\\n\\nto continue is that whenever I found that there's a part of me that is now withholds also. And I'm\\n\\ngetting frustrated because I'm not being heard to also look at, maybe I'm not listening, maybe I'm not\\n\\nhearing and sometimes they would even say, but you're not hearing me, you're not letting me talk\\n\\nand then I have to stop and I'm like, all right, I'm not letting you talk and um, I'm not listening. Well,\\n\\nhow is that gonna go for if I'm not willing to listen and then yet the, what I do is to let them know that\\n\\nthey're the one who are resisting me. This constantly happens in communication. So my suggestion\\n\\nand this is something that I'm practicing every day. So I just wanted to share that with you is\\n\\nwhenever that I feel that I'm stomping into a dead end and internally I feel either hopeless,\\n\\npowerless and then turn around with that, with frustration as if I'm not going through, I've learned to\\n\\nstop shut my mouth, open my ears and allow someone else to be in, allow their talk, their thought\\n\\nprocess, their logic the way they put things together to come in so that I can be in their world.\\n\\nAlthough it might be very different than mine have an understanding and compassion about what's\\n\\ngoing on in their world. See the view of the world from their perspective. It makes me grow. I will\\n\\nlearn what it is about them that insists on being that way or saying it that way or wanting it, desiring\\n\\nit, whatever it is that they are adamant about having. I've noticed that when I open my ears, my\\n\\nheart and compassion into allowance of a conversation to be and willing to learn from it and willing\\n\\nto negotiate and see what it is they want and for me to come into that world. And after I've allowed\\n\\nthat then to ask and request for me to be heard, sometimes the allowance is there and they will also\\n\\nhave the ability now that I've heard them to open their ears and hear me out or be willing to also\\n\\nlearn from me and sometimes they won't, they just will be feeling hurt, but they don't um give back\\n\\nthat gift of doing it for me. Still, I've noticed that the points of negotiation in the conversation or\\n\\nmoving forward with a conversation even if we agree to disagree, it ends well, it ends with concept\\n\\nof humanity, of connecting, hearing and understanding. And even if we don't come to an agreement,\\n\\nat least keeping our humanness together and uh remaining in the relationship that we have knowing\"),\n",

Are people saying you were defensive? Have you gotten that feedback\\n\\nbefore? Have you noticed at times when you are down on yourself and don't have a positive sense\\n\\nof who you are? We might be listening defensively. Have you had the experience of asking\\n\\nsomeone? Do you know where my jacket is and they respond back with? Why do you think I took it?\\n\\nYou always blame me and you're kind of like baffled about how did a very simple question turn into\\n\\na defense and then an attack? So the art of active listening is about hearing the content, the\\n\\nemotion and possibly the speaker's intentions. However, when you have loud, negative and self\\n\\ncritical thoughts that may produce feelings of guilt, frustration, sadness, anxiety, shame, or anger,\\n\\nyou are already full, full, full, full, right up to here. Um And any other information from outside gets\\n\\nmixed up with the internal struggle and does not allow you to take in the message accurately. If you\\n\\nobserve yourself responding in a defensive manner or receive feedback from others about not\\n\\nhearing people and acting defensively, then it is time to check your own internal dialogue. If you\\n\\nobserve that you only get defensive with certain people or certain dialogue, then notice what about\\n\\nthem or what they say. The topic of what they're saying triggers you and it triggers you in a negative\\n\\nway. Ah, those are the ones that the thought process that shows up inside of you as a reaction to\\n\\nsomeone else is, is yours. So, we've got to get to know what they are getting clear about what\\n\\nupsets you allows the observation of the source of the upset. So it can be cleaned up. You want to\\n\\nknow where it comes from. This process allows you to be responsible and accountable for your\\n\\nthoughts, your emotional process and your action. So getting clear internally also allows you to be\\n\\nopen to hearing messages from others clearly and as they are intended, and I'm not saying that\\n\\npeople might not intend to send to say something negative about you. But the point is, can you hear\\n\\nthe negative concept and see if it's theirs or yours or what is it that you could distinguish? So if you\\n\\nfind yourself arguing in your own head and with others frequently and then you're occupied with\\n\\nsome negative self talk that needs to be noticed, distinguished, cleaned up and cleared these\\n\\nnegative thoughts could be about generalization or generalizing some matter about yourself, such\\n\\nas I'm bad, I'm a failure. I can't do anything, right. Um And then you hear everything from that or\\n\\nthey can also be generalized thoughts about others such as no one likes me, people are rude,\\n\\neveryone's an idiot. And that's how then you would view the world. Most generalized beliefs are not\\n\\naccurate. And many variables can be found to dispute the accuracy of those generalized beliefs that\\n\\nyou have. So distinguishing what is real and what is catastrophizing fiction will help you see the\\n\\nreality about you and other people. It's much more efficient when you can act upon reality versus\\n\\nholding a fantasy about yourself and others, which even negative ones because you probably go\\n\\naround with the negative ones versus the positive ones. That's why you get defensive. So when\\n\\nyour head and heart are clear, you can connect with yourself and others in a loving manner. And\\n\\nactually here with the best of intentions for more observational skills, go to my book, Life Reset the\\n\\nAwareness integration path to create the life you want.

Most people look at how the\\n\\nother person behaved, what the other person intended and how it impacted them. Rarely. People\\n\\nalso look at what they did to provoke cause promote elevate and create the conflict or the escalation\\n\\nof the communication toward a full blown fight. A well intended wife who truly cares for. Her husband\\n\\nconstantly disciplines her husband toward eating healthy and going to work, dressed in a particular\\n\\nway until the husband sets a very harsh boundary by yelling and leaving the house, a mid-level\\n\\nmanager who wants to be promoted to the top executive level, but has lots of contempt for his boss\\n\\nand talks to him with a chip on his shoulder and a sense of entitlement are beautifully young woman\\n\\nwho isolates herself without communicating, stops responding and goes on dates with the others to\\n\\ntake revenge and complains that her mate is too controlling. A mother of a teenage girl who\\n\\nconstantly watching and dictating what her daughter should do until her teen yells at her to leave her\\n\\nalone. Unfortunately, until we become aware of our own part in an incident, take responsibility and\\n\\nattempt to revise it. We will recreate similar results over and over again. When we are disconnected\\n\\nfrom our behavior and act unconsciously, we tend not to notice how we co created the outcome.\\n\\nTherefore, we cannot see alternative ways of behaving that may have been more favorable to get\\n\\nthe more favorable result. If the well intended wife notices that her husband cringes and looks the\\n\\nother way and pretends to ignore her when she disciplines him like a child, she may share her\\n\\ncaring or the suggestions so that he can receive the care and love without feeling humiliated or\\n\\ncontrolled. If the manager notices that his body language and tonality reveals his contempt to his\\n\\nboss and that his sense of entitlement angers the boss. He might inquire who he needs to be and\\n\\nwhat kind of attitude he could have to be appreciated and noticed by his boss and get promoted just\\n\\nthe way he wanted it. If the young woman realizes that someone who's anxious and mistrusts needs\\n\\nto feel secure, then instead of promoting this anxiety, uh which leads to anger and controlling\\n\\nbehavior by refusing to communicate and go on eventually AIDS, she could also ask him how she\\n\\ncould create safety and security for him so that they can get closer to each other by visualizing what\\n\\nwe intend to create, we can gear our behavior and communication toward the creation of what we\\n\\ndesign it takes multilateral awareness for us to be observant of our thoughts, emotions, behaviors,\\n\\nand impact on others. Usually we pay attention to what is happening to us and automatically react.\\n\\nIt's great to also have a camera on toward ourselves to see every word in action that we bring into\\n\\nthe aggregation. Every action leads to some results. If the result is not what we like, then it is\\n\\nimportant to distinguish what we do that takes us away from our intention and what can we do so\\n\\nthat we can create what we intend observing the impact of our words and actions on others. But\\n\\nother people will give us constant information in how to gear and shift our action so that we could be\\n\\nhappy and fulfilled with the results that we consistently create in our relationships.

There are many times in life when you know, skills and communication,\\n\\nnegotiation, emotional regulation, expression rising above it all and more. However, you may choose\\n\\nnot to use them. You might know how to empathize and be compassionate. And yet at times you\\n\\nbecome cold and hold on to your negative judgments. You might know how to negotiate in your\\n\\ncareer but choose not to negotiate with your mates. You might know how to communicate cordially\\n\\nwith people. Even if you don't feel good or you're angry, you choose not to be cordial. When\\n\\ncommunicating with your family members, you might be understanding towards strangers and\\n\\nrefuse to accept your Children when they do exactly the same thing. What are some of the reasons\\n\\nfor these types of disconnect? People usually have different beliefs, rules parameters, boundaries,\\n\\nemotional attachments for different areas of their life. They may not care much about strangers and\\n\\ntherefore not have the same type of intensity of emotions or insistence in upkeeping certain\\n\\nstandards. They may have learned a particular type of communication as an adult in a work\\n\\nenvironment and therefore compartmentalized and only classify that communication style to work\\n\\ncategory and not in family settings. They may feel safe and close with the family members and\\n\\nspouse to unleash and express all of their emotions while they do not feel safe for others to see the\\n\\nside of them, the side of vulnerability, they may hold an elevated sense of expectation from a parent\\n\\nthat they would not have from a neighbor. They may think that they have to win and be the boss in\\n\\nsome environment while they're aware that the same thing will not be available in other areas. And\\n\\nso on. The important factor is when you have the tool or the skill and you already see the positive\\n\\nresults in one area, apply it to all areas of your life. Most life skills are transferable and useful in all\\n\\nareas of life. If you see that your communication style works in your career, then use it at home.\\n\\nWhen you see that you can negotiate the best deals for yourself, then break that negotiation skills\\n\\ninto your daily interaction with people at work or at home. It, you experience that you're capable of\\n\\nregulating your anger and anxiety and fear and sadness well, with your customers and use the\\n\\nsame skills with your spouse and your Children. It takes observation and attentiveness toward daily\\n\\nskills, appreciating the skills as it creates favorable results, applying the workable skills to other\\n\\nareas of your life with consideration of various boundaries in different areas of your life testing to see\\n\\nif it gives similar favorable results in other areas of your life and modifying them, modifying those\\n\\nskills when deemed necessary to match the specific boundaries and parameters of that particular\\n\\narea of your life. For more observational skills and learning ways to clear the past wounds so that\\n\\nyou can be open and opening yourself. Um to all that is available for you to learn.

This week, I've been experiencing gratitude. Last weekend, I had a\\n\\nworkshop for therapists and coaches who will be certified in the Awareness Integration Theory. I\\n\\nwoke up with this tremendous amount of gratitude for all of my teachers, the masters in the field, my\\n\\nsupervisors and my therapist, everyone who has worked with me or um make me grow up as I was\\n\\ngoing through the names of people who had supported me, thought me and moved me forward in\\n\\nthis journey. I also saw all the people who had mentored them. I was fortunate to have therapists\\n\\nwho came to my clinic as a trainee and now they are seasoned therapists and mentoring others.\\n\\nThis weekend brought the notion of how we are connected generation after generation, handing\\n\\nover the knowledge that we gain from another to another. This filled me with joy as a part of our\\n\\nlecture. I was uh reciting what I had learned from Doctor Albert Ellis about striving toward\\n\\nunconditional self, acceptance, unconditional other, acceptance, and unconditional life, acceptance.\\n\\nIt dawned on me. Then we're born with those qualities. Our essence as human being is\\n\\nunconditional acceptance. We come to this world open to receive. We accept all that is given to us\\n\\nby our parents, grandparents, siblings, teachers, friends, government societies, the world as we feel\\n\\nhurt and pain, we end up closing in to protect ourselves. Yet we remain closed. We lose the\\n\\nessence of acceptance of life as is we see others as possible source of threat and pain. We also\\n\\ntake things personally hold negative views about ourselves and punish ourselves. We may form lots\\n\\nof relationships while we're closed off, we may even teach how not to accept all that there is and\\n\\nways to close off as a protective measure to our Children. And our next generation, we go into\\n\\nmarriages closed off with no examples of our mate. As is we raise our Children by not accepting\\n\\nwho they naturally are and molding them to what we want them to be. We refuse to acknowledge\\n\\nthe rights of so many people who are not like us as we close ourselves up, we become more angry,\\n\\ndepressed, isolated, righteous and physically ill, which then forces us to clean up and we learn to\\n\\ngain the skill to assess set boundaries and protect ourselves without having to close up completely.\\n\\nAnd hopefully, as we grow, we relearn our original essence of unconditional acceptance as if we are\\n\\ncleaning the mud off a rough diamond and we give it a brilliant shine by giving it magnificent cuts by\\n\\nlearning and implementing skills and allow our essence to brilliantly shine. We deserve to live a life\\n\\nof fulfillment by living our essence to its full potential for more observational skills and learning ways\\n\\nto clear the past wounds so that you can be yourself and open yourself and shine.

Um, very\\n\\nappropriate about for this segment is actually a question that showed up is um, what do we do when\\n\\nwe argue about finances in our coup um in our relationship, in our intimate relationship, whether you\\n\\nare married or in this case, the person says that they are engaged and they're living together, they\\n\\nwanna know what do they do so that they don't constantly get into an argument. Well, it really\\n\\ndepends on the philosophy and the management of the ma the money and maybe even the\\n\\nphilosophy in management of the money, some traditional relationships um have come to some\\n\\nagreement where uh one person, usually the male partner chooses to be the breadwinner and\\n\\nsometimes the management of the um actual finances of the couple. Sometimes you'll see there's\\n\\nan agreement for one, maybe the male, um or sometimes the female to be the highest breadwinner,\\n\\nbut the other person maybe, and the wife or the husband actually manages the money and\\n\\nmanaging what I mean is to really look at um what are the bills? What are the expenses. How do\\n\\nthey get paid every week and then they can come together and start budgeting sometimes when\\n\\nthey are engaged. Um They might still look at the modern marriages of having uh both parties\\n\\ncontribute financially regardless of who brings more money. Um And then they manage it together or\\n\\nsometimes they are very clear where we earn, we put it in a separate account and we will, each one\\n\\nof us will pay certain bills and we don't have to ever merge this financial concept and some people\\n\\nwork for them. What I've noticed with most of the couples is that they actually have to come to an\\n\\nagreement. People usually don't talk about money. Um, they feel shame, they feel embarrassed,\\n\\nthey feel um a little bit intimidated to start talking about finances. One is how much the other person\\n\\nactually makes. It's as if it's a secret and when you're coming to be engaged, living together or\\n\\nactually wanting to be married, obviously, especially if you're married. As far as the law is\\n\\nconcerned, your finances are pretty much together. You're going to be responsible and accountable\\n\\nfor your finances and probably your husband. So it's important for the two person uh to come\\n\\ntogether and look at what is it that my philosophy is? What is it that I can come through and merge\\n\\nwith the other person's philosophy come together with some agreement. There's some people who\\n\\nhave businesses which they can't merge everything that they have in a business, but they can\\n\\ndefinitely come to terms with how much salary they're going to give themselves from the business\\n\\nand put it into an account together. So they can see it, be aware of it, have the information and\\n\\nmove forward with budgeting information, uh transparency. Um having an open hand uh being\\n\\nwilling to give the other person the information is the key. Um It's important for us to create that type\\n\\nof a trust when we sit together two couples and look at what is it that we bring? Um What is it that\\n\\nour expenses are like, how can we budget together? How can we honor each other's tastes and\\n\\nwhat needs to be happening? How can we make it fair between the two of us? Whatever fairness\\n\\nlooks like between the two people and whatever fairness looks like within the agreement that they\\n\\nput together. Some of these things can also be cultural where um the culture itself, the culture of the\\n\\nmarriage and um their upbringing and their families, family of origin system kind of dictated to them\\n\\nwhat the culture of financial uh earning and management and responsibility and power be. And\\n\\nsometimes they'll go back and look at that and just kind of like bring the same format into their\\n\\nmarriage. Again, if there's an agreement between the couple for um a traditional way of a family\\n\\nstructure to come in great as the point is how to get to that agreement. Many people feel powerless\"),\n",

Again, if there's an agreement between the couple for um a traditional way of a family\\n\\nstructure to come in great as the point is how to get to that agreement. Many people feel powerless\\n\\nand the other person holds all the power. Um If the breadwinner is the one who holds all the power,\\n\\nthe other person feels like I have to constantly go and beg the other person for money or that my\\n\\nvote or what I need is not counted. And those are the times that resentments guilt built after 30\\n\\nyears of working with couples finances is one of the biggest, biggest, biggest issues of argument\\n\\nand biggest issue of non trusts much more than infidelity. Finances are the biggest issues of non\\n\\ntrust between the couple and you know, everything you do all day ultimately is going to come back\\n\\nto the some sort of a financial decision together. So my suggestion is if you can't come to an\\n\\nagreement, uh call the coach, call me, let me support you in creating that. Um If you can on your\\n\\nown, sit down and write all of your expenses together as you live together. The most important ones\\n\\nthat are happening every week, the most important ones that are not set but you need it. And then\\n\\nthe prior you set up the priorities about all how you're going to create your spreadsheet. Um come\\n\\nback and look at it every month together, create budgets together and you can move forward this\\n\\nway, you'll create trust, transparent, see um a sense of togetherness in decision making and power\\n\\nand that usually, um, lessens all the arguments and creates the feeling of safety and security that\\n\\ncomes and, uh then fosters the trust and love.

So I wonder what is the\\n\\ndifference between the times that I'm calm and open and um kind of flexible with things that are\\n\\nhappening and look at those from the perspective of all is well, or that there's an agitation that is\\n\\nlooking for a problem to solve, looking for things that are out there to make a point at it. So I realized\\n\\nalso that a lot of people I work with, um they look at things with, for example, they wake up one day\\n\\nin their relationship and they look at all the things that have been there the day before the way\\n\\nbefore that for years. But today they're gonna pick at it, they're gonna say how much they don't like\\n\\nit, which is another day, same things are there, but they're flexible with it. What's the difference? The\\n\\nsame thing can happen at work. You may be at the same type of job for many, many years. One\\n\\nday it's intolerable another day. It's as if all is well, I can handle it. So it is important to know that the\\n\\nway we are with our world either makes it or breaks the way we attend to the world as is it creates a\\n\\nspace, whether we could go with an openness to clear things, to handle things or we can go with an\\n\\nagitation with an attitude with a chip on our shoulder with a sense of entitlement of why it would be\\n\\nthis way and resisting it and then changing it from a resistance place versus changing and adapting\\n\\nand from a place that is like, it's all, it's all well and I'm gonna, you know, core or shift or adapt to\\n\\nwhat's happening or even change what's happening. So they come from, it's almost like the energy\\n\\nyou come from dealing with things. It could either be a soft flow or it could be um a fight you get to\\n\\nchoose. I was privy to look at, I wake up sometimes with a fighting mode and then I have to take\\n\\ncare of myself to calm down that area, that agitation that showed up and there's nothing wrong with\\n\\nit. And you don't always have to look at where is it showing up from? It's great to listen to it and see\\n\\nwhere is it coming from. And maybe if there's something you really need to handle, take care of\\n\\nyourself in some way so that the agitation is released and handled. On the other hand, is also\\n\\nimportant to see if that agitation belongs to a certain matter just because it's here. It might also cling\\n\\nto all matters in life and create more of a problem than it is just because the agitation clung to\\n\\nsomething. So be aware of that. And the more that you can let go of that agitation and allow it to be\\n\\nhandled or whatever the actual issue is, then it doesn't have to kind of spread over everything in all\\n\\nareas of your life, uh, during the day. Thank you.\"),\n",

Um There are times in life when we need to reward ourselves, appreciate\\n\\nwho we are and what we have done, appreciate who we have been for others. I've been talking to\\n\\nmany of my clients and colleagues this week and um they have come a long way. You could see\\n\\nwhere they've been and where they are now um created so many great results and genuinely happy\\n\\nyet sometimes this question comes up. Is this real? Am I just going through a manic phase? Am I\\n\\ngoing crazy? Is it really like this? Is it gonna end? Is it just a phase? Will it stay will, you know, um\\n\\nthe unhappiness um show up any minute and this will be taken away. Is this ok? Like is this good\\n\\nwhen people have been feeling anxious and depressed for a long time, they don't see the vision that\\n\\none day the cloud can be lifted and they can feel happy. Many get caught in just seeing the negative\\n\\npart of their life, negative actions and intentions of others or what has happened to them in the past,\\n\\nwhich was negative when the focus is only on the negative aspects of life. What you don't like, what\\n\\nyou think it's not fair and what should have changed. Then all you have are feelings of sadness,\\n\\nanxiety, anger, shame, guilt, remorse, resentment, powerless, hopelessness, any of those feelings\\n\\nfor many uh this state remains for their life so long that it becomes a state of being for a lifetime. It's\\n\\nas if like that's all they've known. And even if they've kind of gotten that from their family, it is all\\n\\nthey've known because they were kind of like born and raised in that environment, they picked it up\\n\\nand that's all they know. So the state of happiness appears weird, odd something they've always\\n\\nwanted. They have no clue what to do with it when it shows up. So it's like the experience of\\n\\nexperiencing it is something new. But this all around and forever negative focus. You won't\\n\\nacknowledge all the ways that you are changing growing, creating manifesting and actualizing every\\n\\nday. Therefore, you don't acknowledge your growth and resolve as skills that you have and own to\\n\\nsupport you in the future. You may think, feel and at times act as if you are still age five or 12. While\\n\\nthe result of your life states that you've grown up, survived, survived all the hardships, learn from\\n\\nthem and have the tools. If similar matter comes up and by being aware and acknowledging who\\n\\nyou are and what you're capable of, you can feel proud, capable, confident, happy and fulfilled. You\\n\\ncan allow yourself to celebrate your accomplishments, reward yourself with good food, socializing\\n\\nand celebrating with friends and family. Buy a gift for yourself, get a massage and get pampered.\\n\\nTake yourself on a great trip, pat yourself on the back, you deserve it. If you are still not convinced,\\n\\nask 10 people, 10 of your friends and family members to tell you the greatness that they see in you,\\n\\nwhat they appreciate in you, what they think your best character values and skills are, write them all\\n\\ndown, make a collage for yourself and put it up where you can see it daily. Your greatness needs to\\n\\nbe acknowledged and shared side by side with your vulnerabilities. Both sides of the spectrum can\\n\\nbe felt experienced, cherished and shared.

It's great to stop and listen to our internal process. It can be so\\n\\npreoccupied with internal thoughts and emotions that we don't even notice the lack of our presence\\n\\nat work and friendships and romantic relationships and in family relations, others around us will react\\n\\nto our lack of presence in their interaction that we have with them. People around us will have lots of\\n\\nassumptions about this way of being or this change that has happened to us. They might get\\n\\nscared, they might get angry, sad or suspicious about our lack of presence in our daily interaction\\n\\nwith them or in our own daily interaction. These changed interactions open us to many, many\\n\\nmisunderstandings. I've talked to employees who assume their bosses no longer appreciate them\\n\\nand will fire them. I've talked to parents who think that their Children are so good and um are doing\\n\\nsomething illegal or dangerous. I've spoken to mates who assume their partners are no longer\\n\\nattracted to them or having an affair. I've talked to Children who believe that their parents are\\n\\nabandoning them since they have not been the ideal child. So they take it very, very personal and\\n\\nmake it as if I'm the one who's bad. Get the point right now. However, we might not even be aware\\n\\nthat our behavior has changed or that our changed behavior fuels many assumptions since we're\\n\\nnot really internally. Um So since we are internally involved, reality check is what I suggest for\\n\\neveryone involved. If you see someone's regular behavior pattern has changed, let them know that\\n\\nyou are observing a change in their behavior. This observation engineering can be from a curious\\n\\nand an empathic stance and not from a judgmental make wrong stance. Obviously, you will get\\n\\npeople defensive if you give them a negative feedback. However, if your reality checks from a\\n\\nneutral stance, you will probably more likely get the person to be appreciated of you and reflect on\\n\\nthe wrong behavior. When people give us feedback, it can startle us and awaken our self\\n\\njudgmental side. It's essential to take it in, reflect on the cause of our most recent behavior and their\\n\\nimpact becoming defensive and dismissing others. Feedback will make us miss important\\n\\ninformation about our internal process and the leading behavior which needs to change before\\n\\ncreating unreturnable change. These healthy communications will allow our relationships to be\\n\\ncloser and more intimate, allowing feedback also creates a grown space, a growth space for us to\\n\\nsee the blind spot and shadow sides that we would have never seen. Otherwise for more of the\\n\\nobservational skills um uh check into awareness, integration, psychological and educational theory\\n\\nand intervention, it can help you. Um I've made this process structured practice that can support you\\n\\nbecome aware of who you are. Um your happiness times, your depression, times, your dispositions,\\n\\nyour dualities, um how you behave and how those behaviors actually impact your life in so many\\n\\ndifferent levels. This model also helps you complete the past and create an intentional future by\\n\\nbeing deliberate today. And if you want to experience that, um just get my book, I've reset the\\n\\nawareness integration path to the life you want. Thank you so much for listening with your heart.\"),\n",

There's so many times in life where\\n\\nwe have to get separated from people or places or items. Every time, the range of feelings such as\\n\\nanxiety, sadness, anger, and guilt, remorse, resentment loss, mostly grief experience. It is irrelevant\\n\\nwhether we choose to separate or someone else is separating from us or situation and\\n\\ncircumstances dictates. We still go through the range of emotions. I've sat with friends, families and\\n\\ncolleagues and clients this week and this experience of loss, a family which is moving to another\\n\\nstate due to career opportunities and leaving all other members of the family and their home behind\\n\\na man that after 14 years had to put his dog to sleep. A woman who after 10 years of marriage got a\\n\\ndivorce papers in mail without any explanation. A mother who's having her only child leave to\\n\\nanother state for school. Many times there is an anticipation of the pain of loss that we call\\n\\nseparation anxiety. We have bonded and feel attached to someone a location or even our pet. We\\n\\nmay hold so many memories of them. That means so much to us, we foresee a future without them,\\n\\nwhich we don't know what it entails or how it manifests or who we are without them actually. But we\\n\\nknow that their place in that future is missing. That is when the beginning phase of the grief shows\\n\\nup resistance to the grieving stage produces anxiety. The anticipation of the grief creates anxiety for\\n\\nseeing the future without them produces anxiety. Accepting the grief process allows us to move\\n\\nthrough it gracefully allowing ourselves to cry, to feel sad, to cherish the moments that we had with\\n\\nthem to grieve for the future that doesn't have them in it, to miss them, to see their value in our life.\\n\\nCommunicating all that we need to say to ask and to receive from them if possible, create a closure\\n\\nfor the blessing of having them in that structure in our life and completing with this face of life.\\n\\nEnvisioning a life that is fulfilling as a transition happens and moves us forward. Envision a future\\n\\nthat works even without them or if we still have access with a new way of being with the person.\\n\\nSeparation is a natural part of life progression. We leave our mother's womb to be born, leave our\\n\\nschools to another school as we go up the grades, leave high school to go to college or work, leave\\n\\none work to another to dissatisfaction or promotion. We leave our singlehood to get married. We let\\n\\ngo of our couple hood to become parents and we may leave our city state or country to run away\\n\\nfrom discomfort or move toward an upgraded life. We leave our youth and vitality as we enter our\\n\\nolder phase of life, we leave our careers to retire. We live life to death and in between many, many\\n\\nmore separations that may be unexpected separation as a natural progression of life comes with its\\n\\nown natural set of emotions to be experienced, feel it deeply and move through it gracefully. For\\n\\nmore observational skills and emotional regulation, please go to my book, Life Reset the Awareness\\n\\nintegration Path to create the life you want. Thank you.\"),\n",

This past week has triggered an extreme\\n\\namount of feeling of sadness every day in the news, um innocent people killed in Iran for standing\\n\\nup for their rights. Um in Russia for taking a stand against brutality in Ukraine for no apparent reason\\n\\nrather than someone decided to um school shootings because somebody had it was mentally ill.\\n\\nAnd in Florida or Puerto Rico due to natural disaster every day, there's something that brings a lot of\\n\\nheartache, feeling shifts to hope. Watching the power of courageous people take a stand for the\\n\\ncause. Despite their fear, I witness one group's rage leading to aggression and destruction. While in\\n\\nanother growth, the feeling of anger leads to assertiveness, taking a stand against injustice and for\\n\\nhuman rights, the power of anger when put to the right action can move mountains and create\\n\\nsubstantial change toward a movement for the benefit of all humanity. Love is the most significant\\n\\nessence of sport. There's a joy in seeing the beauty and the outpour of love from people across the\\n\\nworld. In sentences, reel songs, post dances, demonstrations, gatherings concerts, marches, walks\\n\\nand visuals and more when they support financially through institutions or one by one. However,\\n\\nthey have the ability to do that knowing that we're not alone that we're heard or seen, loved and\\n\\ncared for, motivates us to continue our mission to grow. I came across this quote. So as it could be\\n\\nthe most significant turning point in our evolution because it means that we could move from you or\\n\\nme world to a world where either you and I make it and where we need to compete and fight to see\\n\\nwho wins to a you and me world. But all of us can make it. This quote was stated by Buckminster\\n\\nFuller. The world aims to create technology to promote comfort and of the medical industry to\\n\\nprolong our life and improve our health. Yeah. According to the latest Gallup poll, the world is 30%\\n\\nunhappier. Our mental health is in danger more than ever. I see Children as young as 10 years old,\\n\\nmedicated for extreme anxiety and aggression. Rates of depression, anxiety and suicide are also\\n\\nrising. We need a different approach toward dealing with ourselves and our fellow human beings. A\\n\\na kinder one, a gentler one and a more inclusive approach to our relationships with one another. A\\n\\nform of relatedness that makes us grow together in harmony. The process begins with observing\\n\\nhow we think and feel and act toward ourselves and others in our surrounding how much rage, how\\n\\nmuch anger and hate to be spread in our conversations, actions and posts how much love, caring\\n\\nand empathy do I share with the world? Each individual can start with themselves? Since that is the\\n\\nonly place that we can actually control awareness, integration, psychological and educational theory\\n\\nand intervention has made this possible um through a structured practice that can support you\\n\\nbecome aware of your happiness versus depression disposition, dualities and how you openly um\\n\\nyou can operate daily. This model helps you to complete the past and create an intentional future by\\n\\nbeing deliberate today to experience the model.

Um I'm a psychotherapist and the originator of the or integration\\n\\ntheory. And this is the tip of the week, the circumstances in life that saddens us and brings tear into\\n\\nour eyes. I was reading the article Pursuing Happiness, the architecture of sustainable change by\\n\\nSonia uh Yory and uh Keenan Shelton, which talks about what determines happiness. The authors\\n\\nsay that 50% of our happiness is pretty much our genetics and determines our set point 10% of\\n\\ncircumstances and 40% they call it intentional activity. This past week, I've experienced how\\n\\ncircumstances surrounding us can devastate us. I was working with a client that has been brutally,\\n\\nbrutally abused as a child as I sit with her or any of my clients who are going through pain. I'm\\n\\nreminded of how human brutality can really impact us and how brutal human being can be. I watch\\n\\nthe world news and see that a 22 year old Iranian woman was killed um due to not meeting\\n\\ninappropriate standards of covering herself. Then it led to massive demonstrations and more killing\\n\\nevery day on the street. There are more killing. I read the news about the war between Russia and\\n\\nU Ukraine and watch how we devastate each other every day for some reason or another. Tears roll\\n\\ndown, witnessing what human being can do to each other. Yet, they also, I present and mostly\\n\\nastonished about the resilience of us as human beings. I was present to how I have been handling\\n\\nthese matters in my life today, which is very different with how I would have taken them in prior\\n\\nyears. As I hear the news or I'm with a client that is going through recalling trauma, I feel empathy\\n\\ntoward their pain at times. I feel their pain and for sure, I share their pain in the past. Since my\\n\\ndisposition was depression. My new any news, any news about inhumanity would take me into a\\n\\ndeep, deep spiral of rage, sadness and really not wanting to live in this world anymore.\\n\\nPsychotherapy helped me a lot and it usually helps a person through intentional activity, intentional\\n\\nenvisioning intentional thinking, feeling and behaving and acting to handle the subs circumstances\\n\\nwith more thought. My experiences with committing to new thinking, feeling and behavioral\\n\\nstructures for an extended time, eventually changed some of the set points, not genetics, some of\\n\\nthe set points today, I experience being an empathic human being who does not get stuck in\\n\\nhelplessness and negative belief systems since I have opened the lungs to acknowledge my\\n\\nstrength, resilience and power as the others, strength and resilience and power today with strength,\\n\\nI do. What is my ability to heal the traumatized support, taking a stance for human rights and\\n\\ntreating each other humanely and respect each other's humanity, awareness, integration,\\n\\npsychological and educational theory and intervention has made this possible through a structured\\n\\npractice that can support you become aware of your happiness versus depression, disposition,\\n\\ndualities and how you operate daily to take responsibility and accountability for what we do.

Why do we hate ourselves this week? I've been working with self hatred.\\n\\nI've been listening to 12 year olds and to seven year old, wonderful people who've been reciting\\n\\nnasty comments to themselves for a lifetime. So I'm trying to drown them out by using alcohol and\\n\\ndrugs and some cut, burn or mutilate parts of their own body to punish themselves for being the\\n\\nworst human being. What makes us hate ourselves as I've listened for the past 30 years to many,\\n\\nmany, many people. As we explore the origin of these thoughts, it leads toward how we may believe\\n\\nthat if the world did not take care of us, it must have been because we were bad when two parents\\n\\nfought, the child saw himself as the cause and therefore he was bad. When an adult abused the\\n\\nchild, she thought it must have been my fault for an undamaged good and I deserve it. When a\\n\\nparent neglected and was not available, the child thought it must be unlovable when a parent a\\n\\nwhile disciplining said you're bad. The child believed that they're bad and they assigned being bad to\\n\\nthemselves. When a teacher was in a bad mood and humiliated a student, she made it mean that\\n\\nshe's the stupid one and no good. And I'll never be good. When a friend betrayed the teen said I'm\\n\\nunworthy of friendship. When a boyfriend cheated, she said I'm worthless. And you can you get this\\n\\nright? When others acted, we took it personally, generalized it and made it ours and produced\\n\\nfeelings of hatred, disgust, shame, and contempt for ourselves. So how do we shed these false self\\n\\nmade identities by doing a reality check based on our actions results and the impact we have on\\n\\nothers by healing a part that is wounded in the past and is waiting to be loved and healed by\\n\\ndegeneris realizing that one person's thoughts and actions do not make up a whole identity by\\n\\ndepersonalizing from attaching a correlation between someone else's action that is not about us by\\n\\nforgiving them for what they did and forgiving ourselves for all we did or perceived, there's a great\\n\\nprocess going through self hatred or self to self acceptance and self love. So for more observational\\n\\nand integration skills, go to my book Life Reset the Awareness, integration path to create the love\\n\\nyou want. Thank you.\"),\n",

The price of not paying attention can\\n\\nbe high. This past week, I have many incidents of just not paying attention and having to pay some\\n\\nconsequences. The first was trying to get into my garage as I scratched the right side of my car onto\\n\\nthe garage door. I went to a seminar and had to bring cash for the fee and just because I didn't\\n\\ndouble check it and assumed what it was. I went back and forth long way through dark tunnels to my\\n\\nroom to get the correct uh amount three times. Yep, yesterday. Um, although I had mosquito\\n\\nrepellent in my purse, I did not put it on and ended up being beaten, um, all over my body and\\n\\nhaving severe reaction to it. Should I say more? I've paid dearly before for not paying attention. The\\n\\nconsequences I shared with you today are insignificant but still annoying and have created\\n\\ninconvenience. However, it makes me aware of how many areas of life I'm not paying full attention\\n\\nto. How about you? Do you always pay attention to all that? You're doing. Could you see how often\\n\\nyou have paid a light or a hefty price due to a lack of paying attention. So what takes your attention\\n\\naway during the day? Some people think about emotionally charged events and rehash them\\n\\nrepeatedly. Some dream about future wishes, fantasies or outcomes. Some bring up scenarios\\n\\nwhere they felt powerless before and create a more powerful imaginative result. Some blame others\\n\\nfor their mishaps and produce upset and anger for themselves. And some predict really nasty and\\n\\npessimistic scenarios for their future and provoke fear, some strategize or think of all the ways to\\n\\nmanipulate, to create the desires that they want the outcome that they want. What do you do? How\\n\\ndo you spend your time when you're not paying attention to what you're doing? But your um thought\\n\\nprocess just kind of goes away. What are some of the external matters that take you away and take\\n\\nyour attention away or do you actually attend to those instead of whatever it is you're doing? Your\\n\\nsmartphone emails, text social media news, porn, work games, Children, pet shopping. Practically\\n\\nanything our mind has become used to multitasking constantly. We might have trained it that way\\n\\nconsciously or unconsciously by allowing it to happen. I decided to go on to a walk this morning and\\n\\nkind of like be present to what happened to my attention. I purposely did not listen to music podcast\\n\\nor audio book. I watched my mind wonder about all activities I had to do this week, then bringing it\\n\\nback to my walking and the scenery around me. And then I watched it get into argument with a\\n\\nfriend in my mind. And then I laughed since that was a fabricated argument, which was really\\n\\nunnecessary. And for the first time I saw these two men mowing the grass and in our neighborhood\\n\\nwe made a connection. And, um, I, we looked at each other and said hello and w with each other\\n\\nand I viewed multiple kind of like spider webs. They were on these dense, dense um um plants and\\n\\nthen they were filled with dew water and which gave them this fantastic shine because the sun was\\n\\nshining on them. I'm like, what are they? So I paid attention to that and anymore, and then I felt this\\n\\nkind of gratitude. I felt grateful for the nature that was around me, the neighborhood that I lived and it\\n\\nwas like, wow, I didn't really ever noticed all of this and they were always here. And um you know\\n\\nhow much of this I was like taking for granted every day. Then as I was walking, I got really intrigued\\n\\nby this artwork of weaving between two trees, by the spider, gorgeous breathtaking. It was like, oh\\n\\nwow, what a persistent art. And then whoops, I almost fell on my face. Here we go again. I was not\\n\\npaying attention to what I was doing and um I put it at a hefty price with my nose going in, right? I\\n\\ncould have stopped and enjoyed the weaving and then walked again. But I had to do all of it at the\"),\n",

But I had to do all of it at the\\n\\nsame time for 45 minutes. I watched my mind and awareness go everywhere and come back.\\n\\nHowever, I became much more explicit as I returned to the present moment. So I decided to practice\\n\\npaying attention to what I was doing all day at that moment, stop what I'm doing to pay attention to\\n\\nanother man that insists on taking my attention, then stop and return what I'm doing. This path\\n\\ncreates less confusion, less energy and a richer experience of what I'm actually choosing to focus\\n\\non. I know that when we're doing a task such as walking around, driving or moving along, the\\n\\namount of stimulus becomes much more vast. However, it is the intention of paying attention to the\\n\\nact of walking or driving that allows the entrance of all other stimuli within it that is relevant to keep\\n\\nme safe in or enrich the experience I opened myself up to consequences and I stopped paying\\n\\nattention to what I'm doing, but continue doing it anyway, while paying attention to something else\\n\\nsuch as driving and talking, driving and um looking, um you know, listening to music or to these\\n\\nrecent times, I've been actually talking on the phone and driving. And then what happens is that I\\n\\nmiss the exit that I gotta go out with. So, these multitasking all the time aren't working. I've spoken\\n\\nwith many, uh, parents of young Children who have been trained themselves to do 100 activities\\n\\nsimultaneously wanting, growing more eyes and ears in the back of their head to watch their\\n\\nyoungsters and be safe at all times. But they must stop at times. Focus on their body and quiet\\n\\nthem. I've spoken with people trained um to get themselves and concentrate out of their body while\\n\\nhaving sex. They're having sex and they're like, I can't, I can't concentrate on my body and even\\n\\nwhat I'm feeling because my brain consistently wanders. Yep, that's how we've trained it. We can't\\n\\neven come in and stay focused anymore. People often report like hovering around their body versus\\n\\nexperiencing being in their body and life as it shows up. Hence the sense of anxiety and\\n\\noverwhelms experience. Let's focus on what you intend to create. Stop consciously what you're\\n\\ndoing, attend to something else fully and allow a full and rich experience at every moment because\\n\\nyou are the one who are choosing to pay attention to it and really experience the experience. Have\\n\\nfun. Why don't you go ahead and kind of monitor your brain a day that you're walking and see what\\n\\nshows up and let me know. Thank you for listening.\"),\n",

This week, I have been noticing all the ways we communicate that\\n\\nassure the creation of an argument and then move along toward a fight. So although no one is\\n\\naware or volunteers to start or continue a fight, the way one begins, the conversation reacts\\n\\nthroughout the conversation or allows arguments to get escalated. Instead of information sharing or\\n\\nresolution is really being a part. And creation of an argument for some of you who have played\\n\\ntennis or ping pong know when people are playing to enjoy the game. It's very different than when\\n\\nthey only intend to win quickly as if they're in a tournament, an enjoyable interaction starts with a\\n\\nperson who serves appropriately so that the playmate can catch the ball and send it back. The\\n\\ninteractions will continue until the ball kind of falls in the middle and does not reach the other person\\n\\nactually pretty much unintentionally. Then they begin again with another set. You know, it doesn't\\n\\nmatter who loses, who wins. It's just a matter of the game once in a while, somebody wins and\\n\\nanother person loses and then vice versa. Now, in a win lose competitive games. The hostile\\n\\ngesture starts from the first serve and all of the interactions are toward making sure to angle the ball\\n\\nin a way that the opponent cannot get to it and therefore lose for part for practicing. Some even only\\n\\nplay with a ball machine which only throws a ball with no expectation of a playing mutually with\\n\\nanother human being. It's just a ball thrown. So observe the way you communicate. Which one of\\n\\nthese are you? Do you communicate? Exchange information, resolve a matter core together,\\n\\nconnect, learn, explore or expand. Do you communicate to prove a point? I'm right. Win an\\n\\nargument or make sure that they know that you are right. Do you communicate to punish reprimand\\n\\ndiscipline or protect yourself? Are you just interested in the taking port talking portion? Are you just\\n\\ninterested in talking, only talking and not necessarily listening? Just like the tennis ball machine just\\n\\nthrows the balls not interested in receiving or playing? Right. So, are you interested in the talking\\n\\nportion of the communication as if you are in the tennis ball machine? Um Have you ever noticed\\n\\nyour part in initiating, developing or escalating an argument? Have you ever noticed your part in\\n\\ndeescalating or the resolution of a possible argument? Do you listen with the intention of\\n\\nunderstanding or do you listen, just answer back. Do you throw your emotions at others or do you\\n\\nobserve feel old and kind of like manage your emotions while you share yourself with others. The\\n\\nlistening component of the communication with interest and curiosity is an important factor. Most\\n\\npeople focus on what they want to say but not how they intend to listen. Most also focus on the\\n\\nwords they use and not the intention or emotion that is being expressed side by side with those\\n\\nwords, you're responsible for the containment and management of your emotions as well as how\\n\\nthey are expressed and delivered within a conversation. Many allow their raw emotions to be\\n\\nexpressed within a conversation and hold the other person responsible for holding and containing or\\n\\neven taking care of their emotion. It is best to contain your emotion internally and then share your\\n\\nemotional verbally such as I'm sad right now about such and such. I'm really nervous and anxious\\n\\nabout, you know what's gonna happen. I'm really angry at you because I heard this or I saw such\\n\\nand such and it really made me angry with that and this might support you not to react emotionally\\n\\nbecause the reaction would be actually throwing all the feeling up, not sharing it with him.\\n\\nRemember if you want, if you don't want to argue and intend to have an exchange of information or\\n\\nto get to some resolution, then monitor the way you keep bringing up, kind of like the defensive\"),\n",

And this is the tip of the week. Success has its ups and it has its\\n\\ndowns. A friend of mine said that whenever she wants to go on trips, she feels guilty that her family\\n\\ncannot go. I was talking to a successful 25 year old female. And she said that when she is in a\\n\\ngathering with her family and family friends and people ask her about her career, she has to\\n\\nminimize whatever she's doing since she feels guilty that people much older than her are not as half\\n\\nof successful as she is. Talk to a 40 year old entrepreneur. And he said he stopped talking about his\\n\\nsuccessful projects to his friends since his movement upwards is so speedy and he feels guilty that\\n\\nhe has a successful story to share almost every month while others would have one successful\\n\\nproject maybe per year. So what is success guilt? The first thing is to know that feeling guilty about\\n\\nyour success is very common. Almost everyone has this experience. We relate to people based on\\n\\ntheir similarities when in when in our career, finances or any area of life our success no longer\\n\\nallows us to be like others. We feel disconnected or others would feel disconnected from us. Some\\n\\npeople would want to treat us and deal with us as a person of the past who we used to be so that\\n\\nthey can continue to relate to us. But the guilt comes since we are the ones who moved on to the\\n\\npath of success, we are the one who actually left the tribe. Another type of a guilt happens when\\n\\nsomeone's fortune becomes higher, their business is doing well financially or they have great\\n\\nopportunities or won the uh the lotto although they want to help others financially, particularly um the\\n\\nfriends and the family, but practically no one can raise everyone else around them at the same level\\n\\nof financial level. Therefore, they feel bad. Others in their family might even request to be taken care\\n\\nof financially. And if boundaries are not set for people and we're not able to say no. Um, there's,\\n\\nthere's gonna be a lot of problem because they cannot choose to support every single family\\n\\nmember forever financially. So guilt shows up again with vengeance specialties that if other people\\n\\nare asking and they're getting rejected, they feel bad and because they feel bad and they tell you\\n\\nhow hurt they are that you can help them and you're not helping them. That's what gel shows up\\n\\nagain. Someone who's happily married, I feel guilty that besides friends who are suffering in their\\n\\nrelationship or even going through a divorce, they might end up saying negative matters about their\\n\\nown relationship to make the friend not feel alone or isolated. People usually enjoy raising others\\n\\naround them to success. However, naturally, as you rise on the ladder of life, you will leave some\\n\\nbehind others who are not growing the same speed as rapid as you or they might feel jealous of you\\n\\nor envious of you or even happy for the one who succeed is succeeding. If you're the one\\n\\nsucceeding, it's sad that they're not in the same level, these emotions that are projected from that\\n\\nperson to you are gonna create guilt. You fall into this natural trap whenever you experience the\\n\\nneed to justify your success or minimize your success. So if you're around someone and instead of\\n\\nsaying exactly how it is, you kind of like sw and I can't say it or you say it another way or minimize it\\n\\nor say, you know, oh, I know I'm successful but the world is bad for me too and trying to justify it.\\n\\nYeah. Yeah, you're going through the guilt. So what do we do as an adult first? Accept it as it's a\\n\\nnormal human phenomenon. Um But let's move on beyond it, define what success means to you\\n\\nand it might be different than what other people's success. You know what they mean by success,\\n\\nexplore the steps you took to create this success for yourself. Give yourself the right to feel\\n\\ndeserving of your accomplishments. You did it and you deserve to feel good about it and don't judge\"),\n",

This week, I have witnessed the\\n\\ndualities between what we want and get the most pleasure out of versus what we need to do for life\\n\\nto work better. The ultimate goal is for the two to be one and the same. However, we do not usually\\n\\nexperience life as such harmony. I want to be healthy and do all I can, I can do to be healthy. Uh but\\n\\nI hate exercising walking every day and eating healthy or I want to be financially independent, but I\\n\\ncan't save mo monthly and once I, once I have the freedom to do whatever I want. Now, not later,\\n\\nI'm positive you can find at least one such a duality in every area of your life. So why so many\\n\\ndualities? Because we're human and would operate more than just survival needs. We create\\n\\nseparate parts with different requirements that work simultaneously and demand their needs to be\\n\\nactualized now. So how do we separate much of the research on identity shows that since we are\\n\\nsocial beings receiving the approval of our parents, caretakers, others, everybody else in our tribe\\n\\nbecomes so essential. We need a sense of belonging and to align ourselves with our society's\\n\\nvalues and requirements. We forgo our own needs to match others. Examples of these values are\\n\\nwhat measures, identity, um love, success, independence and wealth, and uh what are acceptable\\n\\nways of achieving that a person learns the path of least resistance from their family and society to\\n\\nmove forward. The schooling, they have to have to be successful, the practices they have to do to\\n\\nbe wealthy, how they need to look to be attractive. Then you can look at your own life and see how\\n\\nyou're trying to um take on the value and the standards of others despite yours. What if these\\n\\nstandards don't match a person's internal standards and values? Well, conflict arises from external\\n\\nrequirements at internal needs. Since we interject the external values internally, the battle becomes\\n\\ninternal and yields to inner conflict and inner dualities. So what can we do? The first is to recognize\\n\\nthat we are in this predicament, usually we're not aware of this inner conflict until it shows up in our\\n\\nbehaviors and results. Um I say I want to be healthy, but my action leads me to have a result of\\n\\nbeing overweight and have I four, I want to be financially independent, but I have more debt uh than\\n\\nmy monthly salary. So when a person becomes responsible for creating an unwanted result, they\\n\\ncan monitor their decision making process and be accountable for actions that led to a result. They\\n\\ndon't want, they realize that another need also insists on being fulfilled even more powerfully since it\\n\\ncreates the tangible outcome in life. So awareness of our inner parts is crucial. And the first step to\\n\\nan internal negotiation between the components. When we're not aware or don't negotiate, it\\n\\nbecomes a tug of war, it becomes a game that one part wins for a while before the other part comes\\n\\nwith a vengeance to take center attention with the victimized stance of what about me? It's my turn\\n\\nto manifest now. So this awareness allows for the negotiation process to get implemented. The\\n\\nintegration method can be about listening to each part writing down from each perspective what the\\n\\nshort term or immediate needs are versus the long term aspirations, all aspects needs to be\\n\\nhonored, heard and respected. If one part needs a short term pleasure, while another needs a more\\n\\nextended term achievements, which will include some hard work and the negotiation can be an\\n\\ninterval, pleasure and with hard work to get the desired outcome and fulfill both parts. Without these\\n\\nsolid negotiations, life will appear as a series of flip flopping between the polar extremes. With the\\n\\ncollaboration of all parts. Life can become more smooth sailing toward fulfilling life's most desired\\n\\nwith a sense of fulfillment. For more observational assessment, skills and integration, please get my\"),\n",

I'm Doctor Fu J Zane. And this is the tip of the week. This week, I have been\\n\\nworking with many parents who are blessed with teenagers, sharing their anger and frustration.\\n\\nAlmost every human think of having a child as pleasant, sweet and grown experience. Well, growing\\n\\nalso has lots of pain with it. As I talk with hurt and frustrated parents, they share their\\n\\ndisappointment with themselves and their ideas about parenting. They thought that if I worked hard\\n\\nenough fit and clothed, my Children taught them all that I knew and ensured that they were\\n\\nprotected. They make sure they studied and didn't have bad friends. All will be. Well, my Children\\n\\nwould love me as much as I love them and will see and understand all of my sacrifices in life that I\\n\\nhad to that I've done to raise them. Mostly they're in for a rude awakening, especially when their\\n\\nChildren reach the teen years. These are the years that Children test their parents tolerance of\\n\\nevery aspect of life. Teens are finding their identity and narrative of life. They will test their parents\\n\\nideas, beliefs, lifestyles and uh more so that they can form their own. Their peers will have the most\\n\\nimportant place and priority in their life being accepted by their peers is the only essential goal for\\n\\nthem. Teams mood vacillate and will go from one extreme to the other without them even knowing\\n\\nwhat caused it or how it affects everybody else around them because they know how to navigate\\n\\ntechnology better than their parents. They falsely assume they can navigate life better than their\\n\\nparents. Hence the power struggle begins parenting. A teenager is so different than when they were\\n\\na child, telling them what to do directly without explanation of why no longer works. Therefore, the\\n\\nexpectation of the teen in doing what you told them right away becomes a fantasy. It's time for the\\n\\nteam to have responsibility and accountability for their emotional and physical well being, hygiene,\\n\\ncleanliness of their surrounding well kept room. Ha Everybody laughs at me when I say that for a\\n\\nteam study guidelines, time management, financial management, and social management. These\\n\\nare times for parents to train their teens for the adulthood that is around the corner and no longer\\n\\nbaby them. This phase of training, the team for life needs to come from the parent taking on a\\n\\nmentor role who allows the team to be guided with structures and be supported when they try it out\\n\\non their own, whether they win or they fail much better to watch them fail at this age and support\\n\\nthem. To get up and move along versus not allowing them to fail because you love them so much\\n\\nand you don't want them to suffer and falsely create winning strategies for them. Life is not that kind\\n\\nto them. Let them learn when they're with. You treat the teen with love and acceptance while firmly\\n\\nestablishing systems, life consequences and life demands. The stress on teens is higher than it's\\n\\never been. Having to deal with social media pressure, facing gender role, identity and sexual identity\\n\\nat school and with peers having to deal with guns, use of alcohol, drugs and pills, sexual\\n\\nexperiences, relational intimacy competition to go to universities and on and on and on all the same.\\n\\nMost parents want to protect their teens by holding them back from all of it. However, that's no\\n\\nlonger possible. They are on their um internet and phone and smartphones. I have access to things\\n\\nthat you don't even know. So giving teens skills to handle all that shows up for them emotionally\\n\\ncognitively and behaviorally is the key to growing healthy teens toward healthy adults for knowledge\\n\\non how to raise your Children.

There's a way you can talk to promote effective communication or destroy\\n\\nthe message, the relationship and the person's character. If the communication is not intentional and\\n\\nit is only reactive, the possibility of destruction is much higher. I've been talking to many people this\\n\\nweek who unintentionally and reactively have destroyed their relationship to a point of no return, a\\n\\nfather who has a certain standard. And when his teenage son does not listen to him and does not\\n\\nand does whatever his peers want him to do, he blasts in anger and attacks every part of his son's\\n\\ncharacter resulting in destroying his son's self esteem or a um a woman who's so angry with her\\n\\nhusband for not giving her what she needs at home after telling him for 10 years that um she starts\\n\\nscreaming so hard that the husband ends up leaving the house and blames her for what does not\\n\\nwork in their marriage. So when you only concentrate on what you have to say and what you need\\n\\nto gain, the mode of communication becomes like a monologue, a one way directed conversation\\n\\nonly to get your desired outcome without any consideration toward the other person's feelings or\\n\\nneeds. This way of communicating may be fine for one time interactions when you're not uh when\\n\\nyou're only needing to obtain a service. However, for long lasting relationships, there needs to be a\\n\\ndialogue with both people's needs, desires and emotions being considered. Emotional reactivity\\n\\ndoes not promote communication. The message gets lost in heat of the moment. It is important for\\n\\nyou to become aware of your style of communication. So let's observe together how do you enter a\\n\\ndialogue? You do it in a positive and a negative in a kind way, in a derogatory way, in a provocative\\n\\nway. Do you begin with curiosity about the person you're communicating with? Or you don't\\n\\npractically care or you have assumptions about the person or the group you're talking to and you go\\n\\nbased on that assumption or whatever else that crow shows up for you. Are you curious and in\\n\\nwonder of what their needs, emotions and thoughts are or you plan to tell them what their thoughts\\n\\nand emotions and needs should be? Do you consider whether they're ready to hear you receive you\\n\\nand co-operate with you? Do you assume negative thoughts, intentions and emotions from them to\\n\\nyou? Are you aware of your full intention when sharing your thoughts and emotions with them? Are\\n\\nthere any hidden intentions there? Like I wanna be loved or I wanna get my my point across and I\\n\\njust wanna get what I need. What is all of the intentions that are there? Does your style of\\n\\ncommunication consider how you impact them by saying it in a particular way? Do you know what\\n\\nstyle of communication works best for the person you're talking to? Do? You know them enough to\\n\\ndo you consider based on their reactions, their body reactions and what it might be. Do you state\\n\\nwhat you want in demanding way or do you request your want and ask them if they could offer it to\\n\\nyou? Do you get frustrated or angry if they say no or do you respect the answer and negotiate so\\n\\nthat you both are satisfied for more observational and communication skills.

There's a sense of entitlement\\n\\nabout our feelings, our emotions move protect, define and give us livelihood and purpose. Life can\\n\\nbecome pointless if we can't feel. So therefore, recognizing our feelings, experiencing them in our\\n\\nbody, listening to the message they share and expressing or releasing it is our right, our privilege\\n\\nand frankly a must rightly. So we have the right to our feelings. However, just because we feel it\\n\\ndoes not mean we're right about the facts or the thought process accompanying our feeling, our\\n\\nperception of the events and the reality might not necessarily be true. This does not mean that our\\n\\nemotions are not valid. Our feelings are always valid for us. But that doesn't mean the thought\\n\\nprocess is valid as humans. We constantly take data in from the outside world and enter a world of\\n\\nassumptions and meanings based on our creation of the narrative, we produce feelings. However,\\n\\nour feelings is based on the story we're telling ourselves, we tend to hold on to these stories for\\n\\nyears and repeatedly resurface the same feeling as we feel the emotions. Again, we become more\\n\\nrighteous about the story we made up. Therefore, the vicious cycle continues, imagine a child that\\n\\nthought their mother scolded them because they were a bad child. The narrative of being a bad child\\n\\nignited feelings of sadness, shame and anger. Whenever the person growing up thinks about my\\n\\nmother scolded me because she thinks I'm a bad child. And therefore I'm a bad child. Those feelings\\n\\nresurface, this person can grow up thinking about himself this way every day. It could even extend\\n\\nthe idea of if someone is upset with me, it means I'm bad to his girlfriend, boss, friend. Later on wife,\\n\\nChildren, you can imagine and produce feelings of shame, sadness and anger in all areas of life\\n\\ndaily. What if his mother scolded him because she wanted him to grow to excel. And uh when he\\n\\nwas not working hard, she pushed him due to her love and thought he was capable but not\\n\\nasserting himself. Although he would still not like being pushed and scolded rightly. So the narrative\\n\\nhe would have made about himself would have totally been different and produced a different\\n\\nfeeling. So although he has the right to his perception and the right to his emotions, he might not be\\n\\nright about his mother's intentions and her message, he might not be right about the meaning he\\n\\ncreated about himself. Knowing that a reality is very subjective, is essential. The fact allows us to\\n\\nfact check and help us bring the storyline or the narrative about ourselves as close to other people's\\n\\nreality and save us from many unnecessary hardships. I work with childhood traumas daily. I work\\n\\nwith negative narratives. People have held on to for a lifetime and torture themselves with it. It\\n\\nhaunts them and creates a daily misery. They can sometimes check with their parents, siblings,\\n\\nteachers and friends about their childhood experiences and assumptions. When they check, they\\n\\nfind that their experience was only one angle and find that their strength is how they have endured\\n\\nall they have and all that they did take. But also they mostly found that their narrative was not\\n\\nnecessarily true and only their perception what a waste of life when we suffer only based on our\\n\\nscreenwriting of a horror movie about our life, which we find it wasn't even true. So should you trust\\n\\nyour feelings? Yes. Trust your feelings. Hear the message about your needs, express your needs,\\n\\ntake care of your needs, protect yourself. But don't always believe the storyline that you created.\\n\\nCheck it out. Don't generalize matters about yourself and the world around you. If you don't like\\n\\nsomeone's actions toward you, it's OK. Handle it, express and set boundaries. Don't make a general\\n\\nstatement about yourself and others.

We're gonna talk about lies and\\n\\nsecrets. Today, there are so many lies that we must deal with all day. The lies we tell ourselves the\\n\\nlies, we tell others being lied to by our family at work in social media, media, society, companies and\\n\\npoliticians. So what's considered lying? Well, an inter when Miriam was Webster's asked, an\\n\\nintentionally false statement is used regarding a situation involving deception or founded on a\\n\\nmistaken impression, an assertion of something known or believed by the speaker or writer to be\\n\\nuntrue with intent to deceive um or an untrue or inaccurate statement that may or may not be\\n\\nconsidered true by the speaker or the writer. So why do we lie? People like to protect themselves\\n\\nfrom getting harmed, being judged, not getting punished and avoiding consequences for something\\n\\ndone intentionally or intentionally or honest mistake. People lie to gain the reward. They are pursue\\n\\nit such as exaggerating their experience and talents and interviews for work or on a date. They\\n\\nmight lie to gain others admiration and validation in their community or stop being embarrassed in\\n\\nfront of a community for something they have done that makes them feel ashamed, some lie to\\n\\nprotect others for them not to feel bad, such as, you know, eating in somebody's house and they've\\n\\ncooked for so long and you're telling them it was great. Even though you really didn't like it. People\\n\\nmay need to hold a spouse, friend or colleagues privacy and lie about matters to protect them. Most\\n\\npeople lie to hold on to a career of positions, marriages, jobs and control over others lying can\\n\\nbecome a habit or a pathology when repeated so often that it becomes the first go to way of\\n\\ninformation giving. Usually when someone has repeatedly learned that who they are is not safe to\\n\\nbe revealed, they create a persona to deliver all they intend and desire. It's a hard job to keep that\\n\\npersona going. Therefore, a web of lies is consistently manufactured to keep the game going.\\n\\nWithholding information relevant to others in decision making about life can also be considered\\n\\nintentional and part of any of what I just said as far as reasoning for life and then what's secrecy?\\n\\nNow, Merriam Webster Dictionary defines it as the condition of being hidden or concealed. The habit\\n\\nof practice of keeping secrets or maintaining privacy or concealment. Secrets are also intentional\\n\\nwithholding of personal information. The difference is that withholding information from a particular\\n\\nperson or in a specific situation can also be considered a lie in contrast, if a person holds information\\n\\nfrom all or most people, it can be generalized privacy issues and then they're accompanied by guilt\\n\\nand shame. So if you're holding a secret, probably holding some shame with it. Most common\\n\\nsecrets are about having an emotional or physical affair, sexual orientation, romantic desires, an\\n\\nembarrassing incident, sexual fetishes or fantasies, financial situation, financial wealth, financial\\n\\nplans or financial debt, illnesses in their life or in their family history, self harming acts or harming\\n\\nother um thought process or if they have done it before. Addiction, um, an illegal act such as\\n\\nstealing or embezzling money, childhood traumas such as sexual abuse, um past intimate\\n\\nrelationships or intruding upon other, another person's privacy such as kind of like taking their phone\\n\\nor private property, the closets wherever they are, um, a mission or future goals in achieving fitness,\\n\\ncareer, finances or relations in fear of jealousy or envy or even failure. They don't wanna tell people\\n\\nwhat they're gonna do in, in case they fail. So what's the harm with a little lying? A bit of holding\\n\\nsecret?

If they're both holding family secrets, then share the boundaries with people in the family\\n\\nand hold a privacy boundary with people who are outside of the family, which this information is\\n\\nirrelevant to them. If someone is keeping their illness or addiction secret, they need to get help for\\n\\ntreatment. Learn about their condition, manage their symptoms and talk to relevant people around\\n\\nwhich this illness might affect them, such as maybe their mates, their marriage, somebody they\\n\\nwanna marry or somebody's gonna take care of them. Some matters such as sexual fantasies,\\n\\ndesires, past intimate relationships, maybe appropriate to just hold privately with no shame or guilt\\n\\nwhen it doesn't affect the present relationships.

And I'm Doctor Fujian Z. This week felt shocking to me. I was\\n\\nshocked uh when the Roe versus wait, uh decision was made or the decision returned actually\\n\\noverturned, uh, was announced, I spoke with a lot of people and clients, obviously, the words that\\n\\nI'm gonna use and uh the names are not um accurate. I've changed them in order to keep the\\n\\nprivacy of um those people who I'm talking about. Um I talked to them about their abortion decision.\\n\\nSherry said I was raised by a single mom who had to work many hours while I was either left at\\n\\nhome or in other people's home. I remember being in other people's houses when I got abused and\\n\\nI remember when I used to cry when I was home alone. Um, and I just jumped with fear at every\\n\\nnoise. I remember falling asleep on the stairs while waiting for her to come home. And I promised\\n\\nmyself that I would not have a child if I was not in a great marriage and a decent income level to be\\n\\nable to give my child what was necessary to flourish. And although, you know, my mother did\\n\\neverything that she could and I still went through a lot. I decided I didn't want to do that and whether\\n\\nI call it an accident or I was so young and I didn't really fully understand my responsibility to protect\\n\\nmyself from getting pregnant. Um, I got pregnant and, uh, did not know, uh I actually did not know it\\n\\nfor three months. So I chose to have an abortion and Planned Parenthood helped. It was many days\\n\\nof contemplation and many months of depression afterward. And to this day, that decision brings me\\n\\nsadness. And um yeah, I would make the same decision again. Um If I was under the same\\n\\ncircumstances and if I had chosen to have the child at that time, I would not have been a good\\n\\nmother to my child and the traumas that I went through as a child, I would have handed them down\\n\\nto my child. Um I made the right choice for my life and theirs. I spoke with another woman, Sally\\n\\nabout her choices and she said she was date raped while she chose not to take legal action. She\\n\\nfound out that she was pregnant about four weeks later and all she could think of was knowing that\\n\\num she could not keep this baby due to the unfortunate circumstances that the baby was created\\n\\nand her socio-economic status and um life at that moment. So she cried for a couple of weeks\\n\\ndeciding to abort and had three months of depression after the abortion, he spoke to John who was\\n\\nwith his girlfriend while they both had to decide to abort. Since they were too young, they were going\\n\\nto school, could not afford to get married, live and, and live on their own and raise a baby. Their\\n\\nparents would not allow this and they wouldn't help. Um, and it just, they decided it wouldn't be fair\\n\\nto the child to be born into two families which just would not accept the baby. I would shame her or\\n\\nhim for, you know, being born in this family. I also talked to Jackie Bob who just found out that their\\n\\nbaby had a genetic disposition and would be born with many disabilities and heart disease. And um\\n\\nthey knew that the child could never make it to full term. And even if it did, the doctors told him that it\\n\\nhad to immediately be operated upon him. Bob and Jackie had two more Children and they knew\\n\\nthat if they did not go through the abortion, their time attention resources, financial resources would\\n\\nbe completely depleted and taken away from their other Children. So they went through many\\n\\nweeks of grief um for this decision. So abortion is not an easy choice for anyone in my 30 years of\\n\\nhaving the privilege of working with people who had to choose to have an abortion. I witnessed lots\\n\\nof emotional hardship and grief for many years to come. However, it was a choice that after careful\\n\\ncontemplation had to be made. The choice that was better for the mother, for the father and the\\n\\nbaby's future if it remained in this life situation and society at large, I am a trauma specialist. I have\"),\n",

I have\\n\\nlistened to so many people share their story about their childhood traumas such as not being\\n\\nwanted, being neglected due to their parents addiction, being left home alone for hours due to their\\n\\nparents working long hours being abused, being born to a depressed or an ill parent. So how would\\n\\nnot having the choice for abortion affect a child's life? Well, even when people look forward to\\n\\nhaving Children, their life goes through stress and they must prepare to give their life to their\\n\\nChildren, best of their intention and capacity. They might still be um a space where they create an\\n\\nunsuitable environment for their Children, let alone for the parent that is not ready nor can\\n\\naccommodate life for their precious child. So preserving life is beautiful when the quality of life is\\n\\npreserved. When a parent knows that due to their life circumstances, they cannot give their 100% or\\n\\neven so many percentage to the well being of their Children and will destroy their own life as well as\\n\\ntheir child. The choice of not having the child needs to be honored. That is a responsible choice.\\n\\nEven if it if this choice is by abortion to bring a child into this world and not have the capacity,\\n\\ncapability or the resource to provide love attention and means to support the child as an\\n\\nirresponsible act, a parent trying to do the responsible act and prevent future damage to their\\n\\nChildren should be honored and provided medical facilities, psychological support and education\\n\\nand not discouraged by making an abortion an illegal act, ramifications of making abortion illegal in\\n\\nsociety are producing more stress and trauma for women. Men and families who are already\\n\\nstressed. This matter leads to more financial hardship, poverty, illnesses, medical hardship by the\\n\\nmother using illegal means to abort causing damage to their own body. But more trauma for the\\n\\nchild, drug use abuse, suicide, depression and anxiety. People who subscribe to a religious ideology\\n\\nabout pro life can probably also get support from their own community to support their Children.\\n\\nMost other people, we don't have that community to help them in these circumstances need to rely\\n\\non themselves. Maybe the states that choose to make abortion illegal can offer full financial support,\\n\\nchild care and mental health care for the child until age 21. Since they're making the choice and not\\n\\nthe child's parent. This punishment for the parents and the child is really not logical. I've never met\\n\\nsomeone who has utilized abortion as a contraceptive methodology. It has always been a tough\\n\\ndecision but a responsible one to preserve the quality of life for themselves and their time, most\\n\\nreligious doctrines have a forgiveness program for people's sins or mistake. How come with this\\n\\nmistake, accident or trauma? All people involved, even the one presumably preserved are to be\\n\\npunished, stressed to the max and shamed for a lifetime. It's not only a woman's choice, it's also the\\n\\nman's choice who's responsible for creating the child with the woman. It's also society's choice to\\n\\nvote for people who can make laws that benefit the quality of life for the community at large. Thank\\n\\nyou. Thanks.\"),\n",

And here's the tip of the week I wanted to share with you about freedom about\\n\\nthe sense of personal freedom and um actual how do you experience freedom in the dictionary?\\n\\nFreedom is stated to be of a person in going and coming equality before the courts, security of\\n\\nprivate property, freedom of opinion and its expression and freedom of conscious, subject to the\\n\\nrights of others and of the public. Well, one of the biggest aspect of it is as we experience it in the\\n\\nday to day life um is also freedom of opinion and its expressions. And um and you could see this in\\n\\nevery single aspect of life, whether you relationship with people at work um in any type of\\n\\ncommunity, social media. Um Does pe do you have freedom? Do you create freedom for yourself?\\n\\nDo you get attached to something and take away your own freedom even in your own habits? Is\\n\\nthere a way that you take your own freedom by um getting addicted or creating structures around\\n\\nyourself where at one point you're like, oh this thing's got me instead of me having that are most of\\n\\nyou having the same experience with your social media that somehow it feels like it got you now.\\n\\nUm And what are the ways for us to see and recognize that I'm no longer free. Where is it that I feel\\n\\nso dependent? And it just seems like I can't get rid of it. Uh Even if I choose not to, my brain isn't\\n\\nfree, my emotions aren't free. I keep going after something. Iii I get boggled down with different\\n\\ntypes of emotions or different types of desires and it doesn't feel like I'm trained in relationships. Is\\n\\nthere a place that I um feel like I can't express myself or um I will be punished if I do whatever it is\\n\\nthat I want to do. Um Can I share, can I communicate? Can it be a healthy relationship where I feel\\n\\nthat I am? I have my freedom. So when you're looking at your life, it's good to see that every aspect\\n\\nof your life. Is there a way that you could feel free and create freedom within the structures that are\\n\\nthere. So for example, if you're going into a driving, are you free? Well, the point, you know, as\\n\\nyou're, as long as you're respecting the law and respecting other people who are driving and people\\n\\nwho are walking around and the bikers and all of that. So there's a sense of freedom that you do\\n\\nhave, but it doesn't mean that you could do whatever you want at any time you want. So this\\n\\nfreedom appeared to be anarchy. Well, I mean, you live with others. So how does your freedom?\\n\\nAnd beside somebody else's freedom can clash and can it be respected? So the point of freedom\\n\\nwould be that how can I feel free about my desires? Wants space, the ability to share the ability to\\n\\nnegotiate and the ability to respect. Um and then request saying a similar type of re uh freedom and\\n\\nrespect from others. And there are gonna be places that my freedom will be taken away. And then\\n\\nthe point is how can I handle it? How can I see what part I am in control and what part I'm not? And\\n\\nhow can I negotiate any structure where my freedom is taken away? Um Can I agree to some of the\\n\\nrules and structures of the freedom to be that is being taken away? Um in some countries, you can't,\\n\\nthe freedom is taken away and you pretty much don't have an option. But then within that not having\\n\\nan option, is there a way where you could find your own fulfillment? Is there a way to get out if, if\\n\\nthere's a possibility? So it's like within a space, how can I find a freedom that we have people who\\n\\nare in prison? And they say they find the freedom of thought there, although many other aspects of\\n\\ntheir life is not free, but they find the freedom of their thought and emotion and at least within that,\\n\\nthey experience some choices and experience their freedom in that. So find where you can find your\\n\\nfreedom and hold it and cherish it and enjoy it and make the right choices for yourself when you\\n\\nhave, when you don't have freedom. See how you could tolerate it. How is there a way to change it?\"),\n",

But more than anything,\\n\\nfind out how you're taking away other people's freedom, freedom of thinking, freedom of choice,\\n\\nfreedom of being, maybe the way you judge them, maybe the way you shun them, maybe the way\\n\\nthat you don't want to be with them because you're judging them. Um And that takes away their\\n\\nfreedom, whether they're in the work environment and you judge them and you don't allow them or\\n\\nwhen you're not interested in who they are and what they say and what their expression is. So\\n\\nmaybe you are also taking somebody else's freedom away, but there is in a personal relationship\\n\\nwith your Children. Are you taking their freedom away? Um And then they're gonna rebel if it's in\\n\\nthe, you know, type of a structure of a family system? Are you being disrespectful to your mate to\\n\\nyour mates needs and desires and what they say or what they want? And are you taking somebody\\n\\nelse's freedom away? And if you want your respect for your freedom, maybe it's time to also respect\\n\\nother people's freedom and who they are. And, um, this way, maybe we could live together\\n\\nbeautifully and, uh lovingly and respectfully and not only respecting each other's freedom, but also\\n\\nour thank you for listening.\"),\n",

Well, we're gonna talk about taking a break.\\n\\nI finally got it. Yes, I got COVID. It's feeling like a severe flu. It's interesting. Um, as I observe how\\n\\nI've been dealing with it first. Obviously, it's a denial, but it's just not bad since I have symptoms of\\n\\nrunny nose but tested negative on home test and I continued working more than 14 hours daily\\n\\nwhile having high fever on the sixth day of having flu like symptoms. As you could still hear it in my\\n\\nvoice. I finally tested positive for COVID. So, what do I do? Um Should I continue to work? I listen to\\n\\nmyself, tell one of my friends who's telling me go rest that I would ignore it and work. I'm working\\n\\nfrom home anyway and uh it will all work out. Yes, it has all my life. I concentrated on working and\\n\\nall other life matters also just kind of got it handled. I realized that work has been my mental savior. I\\n\\nlove it. It entertains me and gives me a sense of usefulness. Yes, I get significance by working. But\\n\\nthe price is also high, it's getting high by the minute, right. So it's exhaustion, low tolerance.\\n\\nObviously, when you have low tolerance, yeah, lower immunity burnout and much more so, besides\\n\\nsome who just like me use work as an all encompassing matter, many others experienced finding\\n\\nthemselves in all work and no break. In the past couple of years, the pandemic changed so many\\n\\nthings about how we work, where we work and how long we work. The National Bureau of Economic\\n\\nResearch reports that Americans are working 48 minutes or more per day on average, more than\\n\\nbefore. I don't know about that. I think it's way, way, way, way, way, way, way more than that. When\\n\\nI talk to my clients, I hear that when they work from home, it's difficult not to keep returning to work.\\n\\nTheir hours are no longer eight hours at our office, but it's 16 hours since they will answer all emails\\n\\nand phone calls throughout their wake time. They believe they're obligated. They also think that their\\n\\nboss expects them to answer quickly through their waking time. Many who own their own business\\n\\nand small businesses or small professional businesses also continue to work long hours in fear of\\n\\nnot having enough clientele. Therefore, they try to give flexible service hours whenever client needs\\n\\nit. Online work has also contributed to people continuing to work many, many hours without even\\n\\ngetting up from their chair while their Apple watches. I tend to remind them get up, get up. It does to\\n\\nme sometimes I do and sometimes I don't listen first, let's structure the bricks. What do we do now?\\n\\nRight. Structuring really helps. Put them actually on your calendar. Treat your time with you as\\n\\nsacred as your time with your work or your clients check your energy and attention levels to see the\\n\\nbest structure for you. Some say 25 minutes of attention on a task and then 15 minutes off on a\\n\\nbreak works for that one. Some like to work 15 minute and then they get 10 minute break. Others\\n\\ntake two hours of straight work and then take 15 minute break. Ultimately, after four hours, a more\\n\\nextended break of one hour would really be wise at one point in the day. It is necessary for you to\\n\\nstop working really literally and allow guilt free, pleasure and leisure to take over. And uh some\\n\\npeople say, well, what do I do on my breaks? So many things I know that the first thing you do is\\n\\nprobably go on your phone surfing on the net for the news and checking out your social media or\\n\\ndoing some online shopping, right? Well, for some, this might be relaxing and they call it zoning out\\n\\nfor others. This may produce a more overwhelming rush of incoming information and overwhelm\\n\\nthem breaking from activities that rely only on your prefrontal cortex and using other brain regions is\\n\\nvery important and can renew, focus, closing your eyes for just some minute shifting, the focus\"),\n",

I'm amazed\\n\\nand impressed by the human being's capacity to endure pain, survive it, be resilient and reach for\\n\\nvalues to create growth and foster love. Yes. Some people take the pain, the rage and inability to\\n\\nheal, hold them in the same cycle of pain and abuse and some people endure pain, shed love and\\n\\nlight to stop the cycle of abuse and choose to heal themselves and others. I constantly witness it\\n\\nwith my clients and I've experienced it myself. The notion of vacillating between being a victim of\\n\\nsomeone's abusive behavior which holds the abuser accountable and responsible or seeing all that\\n\\nhappened as our fault because I'm bad, I'm damaged. I'm at fault and therefore deserved the abuse\\n\\nand ongoing pain. We vacillate between whom to keep responsible for this pain, which ignites\\n\\nfeelings of shame, guilt, sadness, hopelessness, powerlessness, and anger. After being abused the\\n\\ndecision we make about ourselves and others have become the fabric of who we are and who we\\n\\nhave become. Those decisions could be the motivating factors for our survival or growth moving\\n\\nforward and healing. Some use those decisions as a continuous self disciplining tool to keep them in\\n\\na straight line. I remember the first time my therapist told me, he told me how my self talk was a\\n\\ndisciplinary talk about holding me toward growth and away from pleasure. I now see it with my, with\\n\\npeople. I see that uh their self talk is harsh and tries to keep them from being evil and responsible\\n\\nfor never doing anything wrong again. I also noticed when the client held her pain to motivate her\\n\\nnever to be wrong or do wrong again, forgiveness and letting go of that self talk can become very\\n\\nhard since they have a function and they have a produced secondary gain. It's essential to find new\\n\\nand healthier ways of holding ourselves accountable and responsible versus continuing to foster\\n\\npain and abuse from ourselves. And our internal disciplinary I should have known better is what I\\n\\nconstantly hear based on all the information that you had at that time within those circumstances.\\n\\nMy responses, you did what you thought was best. Now you have more information and can choose\\n\\notherwise begin by holding compassion for the part of you that was in pain. Imagine if a friend or\\n\\nsomeone you loved, told you about their childhood pain or something they did wrong when they\\n\\nwere a little child. How would you hold compassion for them? How would you forgive them for what\\n\\nthey've done? What do you say to yourself to be able to forgive a friend for their past? Uh Give\\n\\nyourself the same courtesy. Imagine if a judge had already sentenced the child for their punishment,\\n\\n1 may have already served their time and should be released for good behavior. Healing begins with\\n\\nallowing compassion and love to pour in and fill your heart. Empathy will also allow forgiveness. If\\n\\nyou learn the necessary lesson and implement it healthily, you don't need to continue the suffering.\\n\\nYou may hold yourself responsible and accountable to a healthy set of values. Your chosen values\\n\\ncan be the guiding light for you to keep you on your path. The goal of the suffering, it's a useless\\n\\nenergy sucking process. Let's focus on the strength on your passion, zest and resilience.

And this is the tip of the week. Last week, I wrote about displaced\\n\\nanger. And this week we witnessed how displaced anger can be devastating to so many people. All\\n\\nmass shootings are a form of displaced anger. When someone is angry at life, their parents, their\\n\\nupbringing, someone who belittled them at one point in their life and they projected to a group, a\\n\\nparticular race or a particular demographic. So who's responsible. Two major conversations are on\\n\\nthe table. This week, mental health and guns that can be used by people who are not mentally\\n\\nhealthy to destroy damage or kill others. Let me say that mass shootings are due to mental illness or\\n\\nconditions. The desire to kill another human being has been glorified by many movies, television\\n\\nshows, almost every major television program after 8 p.m. and mostly in the gaming industry. Last\\n\\nyear, the most listened to podcast was about murder. The local news constantly showcases killing\\n\\nand murder. The international news is about war when violence and killing another human being is\\n\\nwhat we hear all day and all night. It may appear to be the norm of the society rather than only a\\n\\nsmall group who are supposedly mentally ill. When politicians, campaign ads are about cocking\\n\\nguns and shooting gestures and firing guns, then it appears that it has become the interest of the\\n\\nmajority and not one in a million mentally ill person. What does this say about our society? Are we\\n\\nall mentally ill? Are we fed violence? Because we watch violence and therefore the entertainment\\n\\nand gaming industry feeds us more violence and killing because they think we like it and we'll pay\\n\\ngood money for it if we as a society are not mentally ill and there are only few percentages of people\\n\\nwho have mental illness who have the tendency to kill and harm other people and other human\\n\\nbeings. Then wouldn't it be the responsibility of society's healthy population to keep tools that can be\\n\\nused by the mentally ill population easily to harm others out of the reach of these groups, any good\\n\\nparent watches for their Children not to be harmed nor for the Children to harm their siblings or\\n\\nothers, the child proof the house so that the child who is not yet responsible for knowledge and no\\n\\nskilled has access to dangerous material. Shouldn't the mentally healthy and responsible society do\\n\\nthe same for the part of the society that is not healthy enough to distinguish to be responsible for\\n\\ntheir actions. Parents could be deemed negligent and punished for allowing gun poison bleach or\\n\\nany hazardous material be accessible to their Children. Shouldn't that mentally healthy society be\\n\\ndeemed negligent for allowing access to harmful tools to other members of the society who are not\\n\\nmentally ill, mentally healthy. On the other hand, if all the society is mentally healthy, they would,\\n\\nthey would not need tools to kill each other with and therefore no need for those tools to be sold or\\n\\navailable in the past 30 years. Working as a mental health provider, I've had the privilege of working\\n\\nwith many people who are suffering from one or more of the diagnostic statistic manuals diagnosis\\n\\nas mental illness, which had never had the desire to kill anyone or carry a gun. I've worked with\\n\\nmany suicidal patients, but I've had to ask their family and community to be sure to take all harmful\\n\\ntools away from them due to their impulse to use those tools to harm themselves. I've worked with\\n\\nmany angry people who needed to get revenge on another person who they were harmed by and by\\n\\nlaw. I had to de escalate them and take all forms of guns and harmful weapon from them to assure\\n\\nthe safety of other people. When a parent and have reasonable doubt that someone is harmful to\\n\\nthemselves or others, we hospitalize them and by time for them to heal and no longer have the\\n\\nintention to harm. Unfortunately, we don't have the luxury of trusting that every person has access to\"),\n",

Unfortunately, we don't have the luxury of trusting that every person has access to\\n\\nmental health providers, um or mental health institutions, nor that they would recognize that they are\\n\\nmentally or emotionally unstable and actually need to get help. Therefore, as a healthy society, we\\n\\nare responsible and obligated to keep weapons guns, military grade weapons away from the hands\\n\\nof impulsive and not emotionally sound. People. I hear the argument, guns don't kill, guns are made\\n\\nto harm and kill machine guns are made to kill the masses. That is the purpose of these tools.\\n\\nThey're not made for gardening or decoration or meal preparation or anything else. Just harming,\\n\\njust killing machine guns and regular guns are not used for hunting animals. They're used for killing\\n\\nother human beings. So when there is an easy access to guns and you have people who get excited\\n\\nabout killing others for whatever reason, mental illness, personality disorders, revenge, ideology\\n\\nfollowing A F was coming up in tiktok, et cetera. This is the result we get in the US. The ratio of\\n\\nmentally ill is not higher in the US than other countries. However, we don't have mass shootings in\\n\\nother countries. Scotland and Australia regulated and called back guns and they no longer had\\n\\nmass shootings. The ratio of their mentally ill community did not necessarily suddenly get lower to\\n\\n0%. What are we responsible for? I believe that each one of us are responsible for how we are\\n\\npromoting or uh demoting violence in our homes, in our schools. Our work, our career and even in\\n\\nour own mind, we are responsible for the politicians, we elect for the office. We are responsible for\\n\\nthe shows and entertainment that promote violence and killing. We are responsible to making the\\n\\nindustry and violence a very lucrative business. The same way pharmaceutical companies are being\\n\\nheld responsible for the opiate crisis. Maybe the industries that fuel the violence also need to be\\n\\nresponsible for the impact of their product. We can also promote training for parents and teachers,\\n\\npromote healthy, emotionally regulating and violence free homes and classrooms which can\\n\\npromote raising mentally and emotionally healthy citizens all in all. We're all responsible one way or\\n\\nanother for the outcome of violence in our communities and at the world at large, let's take our\\n\\nresponsibilities seriously and create a world where we can be safe and raise our Children and the\\n\\nnext generation in a safe environment.

Doctor Fujian Z and I'm gonna share with you about displaced anger.\\n\\nHave you noticed at times you're angry at something it takes over your thinking feeling and your\\n\\nbody, every little thing annoys you and then you yell at the dog. Have you seen people who have\\n\\nroad rage and with minor movement on the road? They start yelling, cursing and showing crude\\n\\nhand gestures. Have you ever had a bad day at your office and then took it out on your mate or your\\n\\nChildren? Do you notice that people are mad about their life situations and then they get into furious,\\n\\nangry debates on social media. That is what we call displaced anger. It's a defense mechanism\\n\\nwhen one has not dealt with their anger toward a life situation or someone in their life where it feels\\n\\nhopeless and powerless to resolve the real matter, then one holds that anger and it leaks into all\\n\\nother areas of their life. At times, the person is preoccupied with their anger about a situation. It\\n\\ntakes so much energy from them that they have no tolerance for any other stress in their life when\\n\\neven minute or mundane stress matters shows up, they could overwhelm and impulsively react\\n\\nangrily toward them. Anger must be released one way or another. So it burst out at all times and\\n\\ntoward people who have not necessarily done anything to deserve the lashing out. This release of\\n\\nexplosive expression helps the person create equilibrium. However, it destroys many relationships\\n\\nafterward. It often creates the feeling of shame for the person who explodes since they know in the\\n\\nanger they dumped did not belong to that person. Many people did not learn how to contain their\\n\\nanger as a child. They may have had a role model. They may have not had a role model of a\\n\\nhealthy emotional expression. They may have been the recipient of adverse childhood abuse or\\n\\nhave been privy to traumatic events. They might have had to numb themselves and could not\\n\\nexperience their emotions safely. These emotions store and then turn into an internal constant\\n\\nagitation that is waiting to blast at anything constantly. If someone has had a very controlling parent\\n\\nor an abusive parent, the displaced anger may show up as a general sensitivity toward authority in\\n\\ngeneral. This pattern may show itself in schools, the teachers at work with supervisor, with law\\n\\nenforcement or even in different phases of your intimate relationship with mates. The problem is no\\n\\nmatter how much the person lashes out at the world, the source of anger will not be handled it only\\n\\nleads to destructive acts and losing important people and opportunities. If you're finding yourself\\n\\nconstantly being agitated and getting irritated at everything around you, it's time to take care of\\n\\nyourself to begin by writing down what you're angry about. Are you angry at a present situation? Are\\n\\nyou angry at a particular person? Are you angry at a past life circumstances? Are you angry at\\n\\nyourself? Are you blaming yourself? Is there anything you could do about this situation? And\\n\\ncircumstance? Is there a dialogue you need to have with someone to resolve, negotiate or complete\\n\\nthe matter if you can't change the circumstances? Now, how can you accept the situation? As says,\\n\\ndo you need to forgive someone? Do you need to forgive you yourself? Do you need the skills to\\n\\ncommunicate clearly regarding your needs? Do you know how to release your anger from your\\n\\nbody? As you realize what the source of your anger is? Then you can begin assessing if the\\n\\ncircumstances can be changed.

In the tip of the week, we're gonna talk about a life worth living.\\n\\nHowever, it's been a week of conversations about suicide and ending life. I've worked um for many,\\n\\nmany years at the inpatient hospitals and headed to outpatient hospitalization programs for more\\n\\nthan five years. Almost every night. I sat on the phone with people who wanted to end their lives\\n\\nwhile we went through the process of getting them into the hospital until they saw some hope to stay\\n\\nand choose life. These days, conversations with people have also added the notion of palliative care\\n\\nand end of life choice. One thing I've learned is to respect each person's choice about their life since\\n\\nthey are the ones who must live it or leave it this matter. Got me thinking, what were the differences\\n\\nbetween the person's outlook, family's outlook and the professionals outlook when it came to the\\n\\nchoice of ending life, when someone chooses to end their life due to suffering and not wanting what\\n\\nis in front of them. All professionals and family members try to stalk them and by time so that the\\n\\nperson can find some meaning reason, zest and motivation to live. On. The other hand, the patient,\\n\\nthe family and professionals all support and facilitate palliative care so that the person ends their\\n\\nsuffering. I assert that if others also see hope around the person, they all hold the idea of a life worth\\n\\nliving, hoping that the person will grab on to that hope and create it. But when nature calls and\\n\\nillnesses only promise more suffering with no hope of change. The support to complete the\\n\\nprolonged misery comes about when the quality of life is hindered and a person has no hope nor\\n\\nskills to change their life, their view of life or circumstances of life and they want a life, they want the\\n\\nlife to end. When there is no meaning they can find in what it is. Whether they are living in poverty or\\n\\na mundane routine life or luxury and wealth, then they will choose to end it all. When a person\\n\\nforesees the future as a continuation of the suffering or expectations for the suffering to become\\n\\nworse, then they welcome the ending. Contributing factors are depression, loss of relationships, um\\n\\nrelationship problems, legal problems, financial issues, substance use, health matters. Recent crisis\\n\\nand loss of housing thought patterns may include being a burden to the family members or friends\\n\\nbeing stuck, forecasting doom, hopelessness and helplessness about any solution leading to I can't\\n\\ntake this anymore. I cannot tolerate this pain anymore. Family members and friends usually feel\\n\\nguilt, sadness and anger about their own powerlessness and the person's feelings, behaviors and\\n\\ndecision. Many will try conversing, presenting their logic, offering the solution or even attempting to\\n\\ncontrol the person's situation and may come short of a fact, a person who has been entertaining\\n\\nsuicidal thoughts may increase the use of mind altering substances to numb themselves. Act\\n\\nrecklessly as if they want to invite death to capture them. They may withdraw from activities that\\n\\nbrought pleasure since there is no more a point or pleasure, neglect their body, neglect their\\n\\nenvironment, their commitments and their relationships with their environment. They may isolate\\n\\nfrom family and friends. They may sleep excessively or talk about and at times glamorize death and\\n\\nsuicide, they might start giving away money or their possessions. They may start visit or call people\\n\\nsound like the completing of the past and saying goodbyes. Um They may pile up medications or\\n\\nbuy a gun or research a variety of plans. Uh and how to commit suicide. They may even get\\n\\ninterested or completely disinterested in religion or afterlife.

So if you are\\n\\nin a place that you could actually sit down and jot down uh some of your answers as we go through\\n\\nthis type of observation, beautiful and if not, then um kinda work with me with your visualization and\\n\\nyour thought process. So we could go through this journey together. Let's look at your life. What\\n\\nareas of your life do you feel fulfilled that um let's look at your relationship with your body and with\\n\\nyour health. Are you happy with the way that you look? Do you feel fulfilled? Um Do you like more of\\n\\nthe things about your body than what you don't like about your body? Do you feel healthy when you\\n\\nkind of close your eyes and go into your body and kind of scan from top to bottom? I, I feel like I'm\\n\\ngrateful and that it's at ease and calm and there's a way that I can be with it or there are areas of\\n\\nyour body that you feel pain or you feel you haven't really um taken care of it for a while or you\\n\\nhaven't even been looking at it. You haven't held gratitude for different areas of your body. Kind of\\n\\nlike taking it for granted. And the minute that one part doesn't work, then we get all huffy and Buffy is\\n\\nlike, how dare it doesn't work. So maybe it's one of those vehicles that although you're in it and you\\n\\nneed it, but you're not really taking care of it or you do or if the areas that you do take care of, but\\n\\nmaybe other areas you don't. So jot it down, think about it kind of uh figure out which one it is that\\n\\nyou um you know, you, you feel good about yourself or not in the area of marriage and intimate\\n\\nrelationship. If you are in a relationship or if you used to be in one or if you are, um, in a marriage\\n\\nright now, are you fulfilled in that area? And what parts of it make you really, really feel fulfilled and\\n\\nwhat parts, no, still need some work or you feel resentful or there are areas you haven't really\\n\\nworked on. Uh, there's something maybe about yourself that you haven't really, uh, put all of you\\n\\n100% in there and maybe areas of them, but they haven't, uh, you expect something from them.\\n\\nThey're just not bringing it onto the table. So, what areas of your life in the, uh, marriage and\\n\\nintimate relationship? Do you feel fulfilled in what areas you don't relationship with Children? If you\\n\\nhave Children, if you have different types of Children, girls have a boy, you have different ages. You\\n\\nhave a teenager which doesn't let you really feel like you're fulfilled. Um, what about that? What\\n\\nareas do you feel like? Really, really great? And I'm grateful that you have Children and what areas\\n\\nis like? Well, I just don't feel like I'm equipped or I don't feel like I'm doing the best thing. I'm not the\\n\\ngreatest mother or father in the area of career finances. What is it that you feel good? You feel like a\\n\\nsuccess in creating this moving forward in what area is that like? Hm. Not where I wanna be. I'm not\\n\\nplaying big enough or I'm not, uh, you know, at the, at the space of security that I want or, um, I don't\\n\\nhave the titles or I don't have the significance that I want, I don't want the impact that I really want to\\n\\nhave. So what area of the career in finances are just not up to par and all of it that is. And, uh, you\"),\n",

So what area of the career in finances are just not up to par and all of it that is. And, uh, you\\n\\ncan pat yourself on the back and say I got it. I did this and I'm proud that I did this. These are my\\n\\nskills and I'm so happy that I got those um in the area of family relation, maybe your siblings, your\\n\\nmom, your dad, um cousins or you know, uh uncles and aunts. Yeah. How about those relationships\\n\\nin the extended family in laws? Um What is in those areas that you really like and even your friends,\\n\\nthe social relation in all of those areas? What is it that you feel fulfilled and awesome and part of and\\n\\nuh feel connected and what areas you hear like? No, it's just not there. I don't feel it. I don't feel\\n\\nconnected with all of it. So imagine all of those areas of your life and that is it balanced? Is it not\\n\\nbalanced? And what makes you not fulfilled in any of those areas? And then we go back to the past,\\n\\nwhat areas of your life are you not complete with something in the past that still kind of follows you\\n\\nas if you weren't complete with it yet kind of lingers on like a heavy baggage that wherever you go,\\n\\nyou take yourself with you and all the baggage and even if you're creating amazing results in your\\n\\nlife, hm. They're kind of coming at you or with you. Um, are there goals that you intended to have?\\n\\nAnd you just said, don't worry about it, not gonna do it. Are there goals that you attempted? You\\n\\nreally tried but did not um acquire it? It just didn't work out and you may feel resentful, you might feel\\n\\nvictimized. You may feel like you're a failure and those are coming. And what areas do you feel like\\n\\nsuccess that I did it? I did every step. I really put the effort. I really the vision and guess what? I got it\\n\\nand I'm proud of myself for getting it. And now that I have the skills to get it in the area of um love\\n\\nrelationships, were there any of the past relationships that you're not complete? A part of you still\\n\\njust wishes a part of you is angry, um, feel like you are betrayed and it wasn't fair a part of you. That\\n\\nkind of wonders what happened. Like my relationship dissolved and I don't even know what\\n\\nhappened. I don't have all the answers and I wish, wish, wish, wish um are there any of those\\n\\nrelationships that are all still hanging out in your system? And that you need to complete with. Is\\n\\nthere any uh traumas that you went through childhood abuse, childhood traumas, childhood, um\\n\\nsexual abuse, uh molestations, uh physical abuse, uh poverty. You were in a situation that it was\\n\\nharsh. Uh violence um uh parents weren't in the best shape or maybe a parent was ill and just\\n\\ncouldn't be there for you. Any type of childhood issues that you still carry on and the hurt is there\\n\\nand the pain is there. And it's just like the um all the coping mechanisms that you created, which\\n\\nmade you survive, but also limits you as we go along. Any type of um negative belief you created\\n\\nabout yourself out of those traumas, out of something that your mom and dad said to you out of\\n\\nsomething that a bully in the school said to you out of um you know, the first one that you loved and\\n\\nthey cheated on you. Did you make those about you? Did you say that um I am not good enough? I\\n\\nam a failure. I am nothing. Um I will never be good enough. Did you generalize something about\\n\\nyourself or the world that is a negative and is pulling you down, holding you back and not allowing\\n\\nyou not only to be fulfilled in life but to shine the brilliance that you are that is holding you back\\n\\nconsistently and it's like tying you um in knots and holding you down and those are the ones that\\n\\nyou've got to look at and take care and as we go into the future, so we looked at the present\\n\\nmoment and areas of life, we looked at the past and what are your years that are holding you back\\n\\nand coming back to the future and saying, what are some of the missions that you have?

Do you wanna be? Is there a\\n\\nparticular shape you wanna be? Is there a particular health consideration that you wanna be healthy\\n\\nand for your age and moving forward?

Can you envision this beautiful um intimate and close\\n\\nrelationship, a sexual relationship, a heartfelt relationship that you could have and um that you see\\n\\nyourself and you know, you shine and you feel like bliss and it's as if I deserve this. Yeah, I deserve\\n\\nthis. Not only that I bring this to the relationship, I also deserve to gain it. Have it be it and um see\\n\\nmyself with someone until I'm dead until um you know, we both just enjoy every minute of the sunset\\n\\nof the sunrise of sleeping, eating, walking, all of those areas that, that working together, anything\\n\\nthat you want to have, what is in the future that calls you for relationships with your family members,\\n\\nwith your friends, with your siblings, with your Children, um with the society, what type of relationship\\n\\ncalls you and says this is what I intend to be in your profession, in your career. What do you see?\\n\\nWhat is it that you want to be? What, what kind of an impact you actually want to create? Who do\\n\\nyou want to impact? And as you see yourself this future that calls you, what kind of a career is? It is\\n\\nyour passion. There is your creativity, there is your abundance, there is the prosperity of who you\\n\\nare with all of you there and watching it kind of like look at everything and bouncing it off and getting\\n\\nto see how it works with everyone when it comes to the area of finance, what is it? What are the\\n\\ndollar amounts that you desires that, that you intend to create, that you uh what are all the tangible\\n\\nresults that is considered wealth that you see in your life? I deserve this. I work for it. I work hard for\\n\\nit and I deserve to have it all. And but I feel blissed as I live here in every area of my life is the way\\n\\nthat I say I want it to be and I'm free to live in that space. Remember, these are your criteria, they're\\n\\nnot societal criterias, they're not your family's criteria, they're your criteria. You get to choose to\\n\\ncreate and core this vision um as you move forward. So what does it mean for us to be able to\\n\\ndistinguish between all of it? One of the most important factors is to really look at um areas of our\\n\\nlife and what goes on inside. There's a way that um we can look at and observe and distinguish\\n\\nbetween our thoughts, feelings, actions and impact. So our thoughts are those words that go around\\n\\nyour head, you hear them, you listen to them, um you hear them through uh a formula because our\\n\\nbrain and uh the frontal cortex of our brain constantly creates a new model of the world as we grow\\n\\nup, as we hear our messages from our families and friends and schools and teachers and peers.\\n\\nAnd so all the experiences we have, we stopped forming these wonderful and sometimes harsh um\\n\\nstories, storylines, narratives um about who we are, about who I am in the world and about who the\\n\\nworld is and what should be and things should be this way or the other. And if you do this and this\\n\\nhappens and then we create all of these narration and put them together as a model in our hat. And\\n\\nthen we live by that moment. Sometimes we create the Wizard of Oz movie. Sometimes we create\\n\\nthis beautiful, wonderful world movie. Sometime we create a horror movie as if like anywhere I go,\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 's3://drfoojandocuments/ai-videos-2024/pdfs_Aug_2024/Tip_of_the_day_-_English/4.Tip_of_the_day_-_English-transcript.pdf'}, page_content=\"then we live by that moment. Sometimes we create the Wizard of Oz movie. Sometimes we create\\n\\nthis beautiful, wonderful world movie. Sometime we create a horror movie as if like anywhere I go,\\n\\nsomebody's gonna harm me. I gotta watch what's happening with me. So then you, you won't\\n\\nexperience anything that you show you created as you were growing up and picking up all of the\\n\\ndata and information through your own experience or the community's experience or the country's\\n\\nexperience or generation after generation experience that was just handed to you and you took\\n\\nthem on as if it was true. So we take in experiences, belief systems, uh myths, all of them are gonna\\n\\nbe there as our thought process. And as we create this, any new type of experience we get or\\n\\ninformation or data kind of goes through those reference points and picks up and add, adds itself to\\n\\nthose types of ideas. So it's important for you to see what are your thought process. What do you\\n\\nthink about relationships? What do you think about women or men? What do you think about, you\\n\\nknow, white, black, brown, yellow, whatever. What do you think about all of those? How do you\\n\\ncreate those thoughts and uh how do those thoughts and negative beliefs might harm you, hold you\\n\\nback versus move you forward and really be great. And as you move forward, what are your feelings\\n\\nlike looking at the positive feelings that you have that moves you forward? It makes you want to live.\\n\\nIt creates excitement, it creates you joy, keeps all of that more uncomfortable feelings that you might\\n\\nhave. Um There might be sadness of fear and shame and anxiety and anger and rage and a\\n\\ndisappointment. And um those are there too. They all have a message for you. Aspect of your\\n\\nfeeling has a message for you. And it's important to see what message they are take on. The\\n\\nmessage, come back, release the emotion, express the emotion to whomever it needs to be done\\n\\nand then move on and do the action that you need to create for the emotion to, you know, just go\\n\\nthrough the emotion that is telling you the message and pick up the message and move forward.\\n\\nWhat kind of actions do you do? What kind of words do you use? Do you harm people? Do you\\n\\nelate people? Do you do things for people? Do you think against people and look at all of them? And\\n\\nwe all have both. We all have, you know, uh constructive and moving forward thoughts and\\n\\nemotions and actions. And we have really limiting and destructive thoughts, feelings and actions.\\n\\nAnd in order for you to look at your life and different areas and to say how is it that I need to\\n\\ndetermine what works and what doesn't you first have to be able to distinguish between your\\n\\nthoughts, belief systems, feelings, actions, which those create this type of an attitude. So your\\n\\nthoughts and feelings are internal. By the time they become an action immediately becomes internal\\n\\nto external. And then there is an impact. Every action you do, every word you say every nonverbal\\n\\ncues that you give us an action, everything you do for someone, all of those intentions you have that\\n\\nare internal is shifting to an action to get uh implemented and manifested has an impact, it has an\\n\\nimpact on your life and it has an impact on everyone who's around you. And a lot of times with the\\n\\nbigger picture on the whole world together. So it's important for you to also take responsibility of\\n\\nwhat actions you have done that has promoted you is promoted other people. It's gotten you closer\\n\\nto us, it's gotten you healthier as you move forward. And what are some of the actions that you've\\n\\ndone that impacted in a way that destroyed you, destroyed others, destroyed relationships, limited\\n\\nthe, a lot of the actions didn't allow you to shine and other people to see you shine and to promote\\n\\nrelationships that were healthy or you have created and impacted people in a way that the\\n\\nrelationships were not fulfilling and were not moving forward. All of these observations and the\"),\n",

All of these observations and the\\n\\nrelationship that you had with people and the projections and the assumptions that you have about\\n\\npeople having about you, whether you think they're scared of you or they think they love you or they\\n\\nthink they're jealous of you or they think they're intending beautiful, uh beautiful essence and wishes\\n\\nand prayers for you or you think they're intending for you to fail and for them to raise. So whatever\\n\\nprojections and assumptions that you're creating, um it's part of that relationship and then\\n\\nremember, you always take yourself everywhere. So you also have a relationship with you with\\n\\nothers. So wherever you go, not only you relate to them, but you also have a relationship with\\n\\nyourself. If you are at work and with your customer or boss or whomever it is, you have a\\n\\nrelationship with them, you have an assumption of how they relate to you. And then beside them,\\n\\nyou think of yourself or feel about yourself in a particular way which chooses usually the self esteem\\n\\nand self-confidence as you move along the the world in any type of action. So the awareness of how\\n\\nyou think, how you feel, how you behave and the impact in the way you relate to the world, in the\\n\\nway you assume the world relates to you. And in the way you relate to yourself, as you go along\\n\\nwith different relationship, the key to see whether you're going to uh feel fulfilled and create a life\\n\\nthat you are excited about and fulfill or that you create a life that you feel miserable and you're\\n\\nconstantly in a complaining mode and a victimized mode which you don't deserve to be, you\\n\\ndeserve to be in a relationship with yourself and the world that elates you excites you. Um So then\\n\\nwe go into the, as you go through the observation and there might be some element of integration\\n\\nthat you might have with different parts of you that just wasn't unfinished, it wasn't finished up in\\n\\nwhatever it was in all of the belief systems you created when you were two or five and 10 and 13,\\n\\nwhich never kind of got into integrated to the you who is here now with all the beauty, with the\\n\\nstrength that you have with skills that you have. And maybe those parts of you don't know that\\n\\nyou've gained these skills and they've got to come back and integrate together so that you become\\n\\na whole. There's so many ways of being able to integrate the point would be for you to be nurturing\\n\\nto those parts of you listening to them, seeing them asking them, what is it that they need? What is it\\n\\nthat they wanted that they never got and telling them that you come from their future to them and\\n\\nletting them know you've survived. You're here with all the skills and that you hear you and that you\\n\\nwill be able to give you what you need and you will, if you don't know, you will find the skills to give\\n\\nyou what you need and that you don't need other people to give you, that you will create it for\\n\\nyourself. Even if it's the asking the resources for others and how to be given to you, allowing\\n\\nyourself to heal, knowing that you deserve to heal every aspect of you. And then looking at living in\\n\\nan intentional world, if you have the option, what you do, what values do you choose to live by?\\n\\nWhat values do you want, desire to have in your thought process? What values do you intend to act\\n\\non? So let yourself know what kind of values do you see in others that you cherish and you can take\\n\\nthem on and say I own it now. And I'm gonna take those values for myself. Look, create a vision as\\n\\nif you have a vision statement and a mission statement for yourself. So write them down, look at all\\n\\nthe thought process. Every thought that you say from here on, I intend to think this way because this\\n\\nway of thinking works for me doesn't limit me. It moves me forward, it expands me and allows me to\"),\n",

It moves me forward, it expands me and allows me to\\n\\nplay. It allows me to work, it allows me to connect. So these thought process are the ones that I'm in\\n\\nshoes and this other thought process which are negative and be limiting and hold me back and\\n\\ncreate reasons. And I just don't want to think like that anymore. You don't have control about all the\\n\\nautomatic thoughts that show up, but you certainly have a lot of control in which one you're gonna\\n\\npay attention to which one you're gonna subscribe to which one you're gonna take, have an\\n\\nownership of and which one you're going to recite consistently in your brain and uh even share it\\n\\nthrough your words with other people. What kind of emotions do you choose to feel? You don't have\\n\\nall the options of choosing all the emotions as they show up. But again, you have the option and the\\n\\nskills to hold on to the emotions that you like and release the emotions that you don't like. If you like\\n\\njoy and you wanna expand the times of the day that you experiencing joy, but then think about it, do\\n\\nthe body work to create joy, do the exercises to experience and you know, throw all of the chemicals\\n\\nup there that you experience joy, think of thoughts that create joy, create visualizations that create\\n\\njoy. And if you're uncomfortable with your anger or s have this fear and shame, then listen to them,\\n\\nhonor them, feel them, find out what, what message they have, promise that you will take care of\\n\\nthat message and then release them from your body and move along to do something for yourself\\n\\nand then come back and uh do the things you need to do to go back into the experience of joy and\\n\\nhappiness. If you feel comfortable with your sadness and anger, but enjoy them, do whatever it is,\\n\\nchoose feelings that you choose and are comfortable and feel related to have we live by our\\n\\nemotions and feelings. So choose the ones that you deserve to live by and then choose the actions\\n\\nthat you say you're proud, the actions that whoever sees you do. They can also be proud of you\\n\\nactions that don't have to go consistently and clean up actions that move you forward and not\\n\\nbackwards or hold you back. Actions that are not only for greater you but greater everyone and\\n\\ngreater. All the people that are around you in the world at large because you live in that world with\\n\\nother people. So it can't be just greater for you and not for them and then choose the impact that\\n\\nyou like. And um as long as you create the thought process, emotion and action to go toward the\\n\\ncreation of impact, you will have a higher probability to create the impact that you actually intended.\\n\\nAnd if not, you can always go back and core it from with the people around you, the impact that you\\n\\nactually want and then create feedback loops and um visual collages, audio messages for yourself,\\n\\nan accountability buddy, a great friend who will let you know and hold you up to those values and\\n\\ngoals and things that you have and said that it's gonna call me forward to remind you to be your\\n\\nmirror, to be your mentor and um you're not alone. So don't act like you're alone. Ask for resources\\n\\nout there. And have people around. You, pick people around you that you feel safe, that you feel\\n\\njoyous about, that they bring you love and that you can give them love freely and you can be you\\n\\nand be proud of who you can be. And in their eyes, you get that they love you for who you are and\\n\\nthey love you for being you and they appreciate you for being and that you love them and appreciate\\n\\nfor being with them.

Well, yesterday was Mother's Day. Why am\\n\\nI saying it today? Because I think any day could be a Mother's Day. So I wanted to share these\\n\\nsentiments with you. So to all the mothers out there here is to you yesterday or any day a day for\\n\\nthe world around you to celebrate you for all you have done and who you have been. Hopefully a\\n\\nday of you being pampered and died. I wish it was that simple. It's much more complex than that. I\\n\\nconsistently hear it right after the Mother's Day or before Mother's Day with my clients talking about\\n\\nall that goes on. So I just wanted to share with you. They're remembering the scheduling, the gifting\\n\\nand wining and dining is only one part of this great day. Enjoyment. Might be partial devour it as\\n\\nmuch as you can. Your expectations of how you wanted it to be might not be fulfilled. Exactly as you\\n\\nimagine, one of your Children might not act as enthusiastically or even remember or share verbally\\n\\nhow much they appreciate you. You might even be upset with your mate or your children's father for\\n\\nnot playing a stronger role in enticing your Children to celebrate you as you deserve it. Remember,\\n\\nyou deserve it regardless of whether you are shown or told the way you hoped for. Appreciate what\\n\\nis being expressed in the way your mate and your Children can express it. You might continue to be\\n\\ndisappointed if you hold your breath until you get it your way. If you're a mom who has lost a child,\\n\\nthe state might be devastating for you. Sadness, sorrow, grief might surface and every single day\\n\\nand especially on mother's day, cherish the amount of time that you are able to be a mom. You had\\n\\nother Children cherish all who are here with you for all the people who have lost their mother to\\n\\nillness and death. The day brings a sense of grief and sorrow for you. If they had a good memory\\n\\nand good relationship with their mother, they wish their mom was still alive or the ones that did not\\n\\nhave a good relationship with their mom. Another painful sorrow adds the wish that they would have\\n\\nhad one. It may be beneficial to remember the good memories of your mom and hold on tight to\\n\\nthose beautiful memories and be grateful that you had it. And you had the opportunity to experience\\n\\nfor all the people who did not have a mom when growing up due to an early death or being far away\\n\\nfrom them and never experienced being nurtured by a mother. There may be a feeling of void or\\n\\nemptiness, a feeling of non relatedness with others. This day can be a day of being grateful for\\n\\npeople who were nurturing you and mothering you regardless of their gender or their role. Maybe a\\n\\nfamily member, a teacher, a mentor, a neighbor, an older sibling look closely and see who played\\n\\nthat role. Even in small amounts cherish it, feel blessed and share your gratitude and for all of you\\n\\nwho have your lovely mom around but are not in good terms with her. Maybe a relationship was\\n\\nnever that great or that it was once and it kind of changed in time. This day may be difficult for you\\n\\nsince celebrating and appreciating your mom may bring all the unresolved matters right up to your\\n\\nface and possibly hers. This day is a good day to either split off and only focus on celebrating the\\n\\ngood.

Now, this week, I've been working with\\n\\nmany people, including myself and refining the voice that disciplines us internally. You know, the\\n\\none that says, stop, it, don't do that or as it may be a little bit harsher than that, shut up won't get\\n\\nanywhere. You are a loser, you are fat, ugly, whatever, right? Every child gets disciplined by an\\n\\nadult, whether it is their parent, grandparents, caregivers, nanny or a teacher at times several\\n\\npeople at the same time, depending on the situation that the child is in. The more the disciplinarian\\n\\nhas a harsh voice and is punitive, the more the child will interject harsh ways of self discipline.\\n\\nThere's also inconsistent disciplining that gets interjected and you may experience it as allowing\\n\\nyourself to procrastinate or act on something that you know, and believe is not good for you and\\n\\nthen become really punitive and harsh with yourself and end up with feeling of guilt, shame,\\n\\nfrustration, and disgust toward the self. Listening to different parts of yourself is so important,\\n\\nallowing yourself to hear with different parts and needs and desires with curiosity and to respect\\n\\nourselves for wanting whatever it is that we want, we don't have to act on our desires. The\\n\\nassessment of what is right for us to do in deciding which needs or desires to fulfill. Happens after\\n\\nhearing our different parts, a part of us might want novelty while another part wants stability. If we\\n\\nsuppress the part that wants novelty consistently, since the voice of the need for security is higher,\\n\\nwe might become bored, depressed and unfulfilled. If the other hand, we favor novelty over security,\\n\\nwe might lose valuable assets or relationships. You can see how important it becomes to hear all\\n\\nparts and make a negotiation based on what we find. Like any other relationship, the relationship to\\n\\nself needs cooper stance and good dialogue. Yes. In our dialogues are exactly as two people in a\\n\\nrelationship, negotiate and positive. You have experienced that when one part of you is unhappy, it\\n\\nwill interfere with all other aspects of your life at times. No amount of discipline will get you to do\\n\\nwhat other parts want or get your other parts back. Have you ever had the experience that you said I\\n\\nwon't eat unhealthy. And another part disregards you completely and um, you wake up from the\\n\\ndays too full of a stomach, knowing that another part just ate whatever he wanted to. He ever said,\\n\\nI'm going to go to bed early and the part of you that wanted excitement. Sat in front of the television\\n\\nuntil 2 a.m. as if you had no control over that part. You know what I mean? The only way that\\n\\nintegrity happens is when you have heard and considered all parts of you and have negotiated fairly\\n\\nenough so that you can keep your commitment without another part sabotaging your intended\\n\\nresult. So let's look at what to do. It's important for you to be respectfully curious about yourself, be\\n\\nwilling to listen, journal, talk out loud and record yourself, talk to a therapist, a coach or a confidant\\n\\nto be able to hear yourself out there instead of only in your head that all parts of you have their say,\\n\\nexplore the pros and cons of each desire or need with the situation at hand and see what is\\n\\nappropriate and applicable to the situation at hand, negotiate between the parts. So that even if one\\n\\ndesire is not being dealt with that, that part is gaining something out of this arrangement and set up\\n\\naction plans and check again with all parts of you to agree and commit and then take action for\\n\\nmore observational and integration of skills and become fully present in whole. In my book, Life\\n\\nReset the Awareness integration path to create the life you want. Thank you.\"),\n",

This is Doctor Fu Jz and here is the tip of the week. There's a blessing in regulating\\n\\nemotions and seeing all angles before communicating about a matter that holds a high, high angry\\n\\ncharge. Usually when we are triggered by something someone says or does we feel hurt, sad, angry\\n\\nor anxious, we tend to get caught in looking at things from one angle. We may pay it focused\\n\\nattention to the negative, only exaggerate the significance of the negative angle and make that the\\n\\nonly matter of concern. Maybe we felt threatened, belittled, put down, betrayed, not seen, not heard,\\n\\nanxious, powerless or sad. Any of these feelings can trigger an obsessive thinking loop of how we\\n\\ncan prove teach lesson set a boundary, harm the other person or make them feel the way we felt\\n\\nand make sure they will never do it again. The look may continue to prove how much we are a\\n\\nvictim. It's not fair always has happened to me and certainly poor me thinking, but we attempt to\\n\\nshare from this highly emotional chart state. Communication does not go well, not end well. We tend\\n\\nto hurt the other person and end up feeling hurt more. And in the end, we might feel more sad and\\n\\nunresolved since rarely, the person who hurt us uh has the ability to sit with us and uh with our\\n\\nhighly emotional charge and attacks and offer compassion and empathy toward us. So beyond the\\n\\nintention of immediate emotional release on someone which will leave them more separated from\\n\\nus, we will not fulfill any other intention or so what do we do when we're really pissed and want to\\n\\ngive them a piece of our mind. So one, I got 20 items for you ready? All right. The first one, zip, zip\\n\\nthe mouse. Give it time. Remove yourself from the person either by gracefully going to another room\\n\\nor even stating, give me some time to process um what we talked about and then remove yourself.\\n\\nYou can even let them know how long you may need to be doing this process. Three, find a safe\\n\\nand isolated place to be able to reflect. Four. Begin writing down what happened only the facts.\\n\\nFive, right? What did you make it mean about yourself about the other person or life in general?\\n\\nSix? How is what happens similar to the past events with the maybe the same person or on your\\n\\nown? Seven. How would that happen? How would, what happened to impact your future? Hey, what\\n\\ndo you need from this person? Nine, what do you want from this person? Not me? But want 10. Now\\n\\ndetermine if it is a real need or a desire or is it a fantasy, wishful thinking? 11 determine if this\\n\\nperson could realistically fulfill your needs or desires like your desire and need might be realistic. But\\n\\nis it really realistic that this person could give it to you? 12, modify your desire to the reality of what\\n\\nthis person can offer? 13, formulate your request. 14. Now it's time to share. This is the way you\\n\\nshare. Now 15 request for their the undivided attention and open listening. 16 state what you\\n\\nappreciate about them and the topic that was discussed. 17, tell them what you heard and what you\\n\\nsaw only the facts, observable behaviors. 18, tell them what you made it mean for yourself. 90 tell\\n\\nthem how it made you feel and 20 tell them your request. Now these 20 steps processes will allow\\n\\nus to care for and respect ourselves and our needs while determining what is it that we are needing\\n\\nto discuss. There's certainly a higher chance of getting someone to listen and have the desire to\\n\\ngive us what we want them to give us when this approach is utilized versus immediate dumping of\\n\\nemotional garble Burbage problem.

So what if you're tired, burn out and\\n\\nyet have so much zest inside for reaching the goals. The two parts at times oppose each other. I\\n\\nspoke with a young woman who has finished her schooling and is ready to launch her career but is\\n\\ntired already of 20 years of studying and scared of taking on the adult role. Whenever she thinks of\\n\\nlooking for a job, her stomach cringes and becomes a little girl who whines and says, I don't wanna\\n\\nget a job. I want to stay forever. 18, I'm tired already knowing that growing up is inevitable and what\\n\\nshe's pushing away is forcing itself toward her. I spoke with a 45 year old man who has launched his\\n\\nbusiness and is struggling through the first two years and sees the potential for future earnings and\\n\\ngrowth. Has the vision of where to go and how to get there. But he's tired already. He's angrily\\n\\nfrustrated all the time. He yells at his wife and Children because he's tired and exhausted and yet\\n\\nthe zest and passion of his growth is brewing inside. I spoke with a 62 year old woman who has\\n\\ncome from a very tough childhood, pulled her through and has made it to where she wants in her\\n\\nlife, career and family. A part of her says she should retire and enjoy life as is yet another part piles\\n\\nelaborate projects for her. Her body can't take it anymore and won't cooper. She's tired and no\\n\\nlonger has the stamina for lofty vision. Another man I spoke with wants to take off and share his\\n\\nskills with the world and his fears of playing big and being known and being harmed. If he's, you\\n\\nknow, stops him, he's tired of taking a risk and losing it all. But what can you do when one part of\\n\\nyou is desiring to run forward and another is tired, already sitting and not moving or just pure scared.\\n\\nThe short answer is lots of good negotiation between the two parts. It's important for us to\\n\\ndistinguish between fantasies and goals, realistic fears versus irrational fears, temporary setbacks\\n\\nversus the conditions versus um and condition, temporary setbacks and conditions versus\\n\\npermanent or ongoing phase of life changes. So when it comes to fantasies versus goals, human\\n\\nbeings are future oriented, creative, visual imaging beings, there are so many possibilities that we\\n\\nvisualize and can choose to implement fantasies are visualizations that are based on creativity.\\n\\nWhen the visualization begins to get some form of reality and can be implemented in real\\n\\nobservable life, then it becomes a goal that with concrete actions can be manifested realistic fears\\n\\nversus irrational ones. Well, the real danger people or situation that can harm us. There are also\\n\\nwhat ifs, what if, what if thoughts that when you run them through a logical rational chain of analysis,\\n\\njust don't hold up with reality and then temporary situation versus permanent phase of life changes.\\n\\nThere are times that someone has worked hard or has been stressed for a period due to an\\n\\nunfortunate situation or a period of growth. Well, in these instances, a person can just take some\\n\\ntime off, replenish and recuperate, manage their sleeping and uh exercise habits. There's also a\\n\\nrealization that a situation or deterioration is permanent due to maybe an injury or aging in this stem.\\n\\nWe need to respect the new faith grieve for the old ways of being the energy we used to have in the\\n\\nzest and adapt our lives to the new energy level or abilities. I've noticed that the two sides of me\\n\\nnegotiate constantly. One part is excited to conquer the world gets uh giddy filled with the zest of life\\n\\nwhile another gets tired and does not have the capacity nor the energy to do as much as I used to.\\n\\nAt 60 years of age, my body can't operate without eight hours of sleep and can't even multitask as\\n\\nwell as I used to.

At times, there's feelings of\\n\\nsadness about letting go of long term visions that could have been, it is also an identity that has\\n\\nbeen built around the career, a way of conducting a daily activity that resists a change toward some\\n\\nnew way of structuring or repurposing life.

I'm Doctor Fu Zain. And this is the tip of the week. Our thought process is set up to\\n\\nsee all that is wrong and try to fix it. We even have the capability of thinking of all future possible\\n\\nwrongs, all that could ever go wrong. And the worst case scenarios, we often keep all that. We went\\n\\nwrong in the past and rehash it consistently in the present moment. We might take one thing that\\n\\nhappened to us that we did not like and generalize it to who we are as a character and then try to fix\\n\\nourselves, right? I'll say something like I'm bad. I'm not good enough. I'm no good for anything. And\\n\\nthen we tried to start fixing ourselves because we added those types of labels to ourselves. This\\n\\nmorning. I listened to a meditation with Doctor Law Kelly on the waking up app and um in the\\n\\nmeditation like pondering on the question up, what if there was no problem to fix? So as I pondered,\\n\\nI watched in my mind how to dance with itself to try to find something I could hear it. But what about\\n\\nthis and what about that. As I repeated the mantra, am my mind stopped in disbelief. It bargained\\n\\nwith me, then ignored the sentence and continued to plan out the day when I brought it back to what\\n\\nif there was no problem to fix? And then it became quiet as if it had no purpose anymore to run\\n\\naround. After some minutes of bargaining, the feeling of joy appeared dancing and being present\\n\\nwith what was around me. Like my mind was quiet. Just observing, I began moving and going into\\n\\nthe kitchen to make my breakfast. And then I asked, am I fixing something? Is it my hunger is\\n\\nmaking food and eating my breakfast out of fixing my hunger? Can it be just joy? Um desire? I\\n\\nasked this question as I faced any of the tasks for the day, it became a game of choice. I could\\n\\nchoose everything and every task from an angle of choice to act upon it from joy, curiosity and\\n\\nexperience or just fixing the problem with the resentment and the irritation and frustration. The few\\n\\ncertainly became different, much lighter, almost like as I was giggling through the day, even doing\\n\\ntherapy and being with my clients was not about fixing the problems anymore. It became about the\\n\\njoy of being and connecting to another human being with love, acceptance and yes joy. It is close to\\n\\nmidnight. It was close to midnight and I still filled with energy of being present with every moment as\\n\\na choice to be with what is in front of me versus an attempt to fix it. So try this out as you wake up\\n\\nponder on this question, what if there's no problem to fix? Observe each of your thought feeling and\\n\\nactions and evaluate it? If it's trying to fix something redirect. Now come to the thought feeling and\\n\\nact from being present with what is and add some joy and excitement as you face the world, be\\n\\ncurious and wonder what, what is versus a problem to fix. Wonder about what is versus a problem to\\n\\nfix and try this up. Get pleasantly surprised by all the things that you take for granted like peace,\\n\\nright? If you have it around you instead of war, hot water, um you have the ability to have bathroom\\n\\nin your house, food to eat uh close to wear a roof on the top of your head, a good car to drive.\\n\\nAnything, anything that you usually take for granted as if it should be here, scream with the joy as\\n\\nyou wake up and you notice you're alive. It's a good thing. Turn on the light and get excited that you\\n\\nhave electricity. Enjoy the water from pipes and feel blessed, go through the day and be pleasantly\\n\\nsurprised at all that you have around you more observational integration of skills also to become\\n\\nmore present and home.

Um This is Doctor Fue Zin and this is the tip of the week. Fear of being seen. Yes.\\n\\nBeing seen, most people complain about not being seen for who they are, want to be seen and\\n\\nheard for their desires, want strength and resiliency, they need to be loved and accepted for who\\n\\nthey are in all the way they show up in the world. Even for their vulnerabilities, there's also fear of\\n\\nbeing seen and judged when they're not at their best. Make a mistake act inappropriately and are\\n\\nnot up to par with what is expected. I spoke with a professional who wants to play big, expand his\\n\\npractice and have a more substantial presence in social media. However, every time he needs to\\n\\nmove forward, fear holds him back. I had a talk with a young woman who was crying before her\\n\\nwork evaluation for the fear of being seen for the mistakes that she has done. And we're constantly\\n\\nwith clients who have social anxiety due to predicting that they will be seen before sure will be\\n\\njudged by others. Fear of being judged by others can become paralyzing. Most of these fears are in\\n\\na person's own judgment to themselves. Some have lived with judgmental parents who share their\\n\\nnegative opinions more than their positive ones. Therefore, they interjected their parents voice and\\n\\nprojecting it as if everyone in the world would evaluate them the same way their parents did. Some\\n\\nare aware of the cultural or societal negative judgments and know that if they are seen for that part\\n\\nof them, that is devalued by the society, they will be judged harshly. Some have been punished for a\\n\\nway of being or an action and became afraid of being punished again. Some don't want to be\\n\\npublicly humiliated by being judged. Most people like to be seen and rewarded for the parts they\\n\\nvalue themselves and are valued by society and prefer others not to see the parts that neither they\\n\\nnor society approve of the truth. Is every, every human being has this fear and will experience being\\n\\njudged by another person or a community sometime during their life. How do he one? No, that is is a\\n\\nhuman condition. It is impersonal although it feels personal but we all go through it. Two, observe\\n\\nthe fear, experience the fear in your body wherever it is, breathe through the fear and release it.\\n\\nThree, observe the voice that produces the fear. Recognize the voice. Is it your mom, your dad's\\n\\nolder siblings, teachers, peers or is it yours? Four. Observe if the subject of the judgment is\\n\\nsomething about you that is about your character, your body or your action. Five, observe if the\\n\\nsubject of the judgment is a matter that can be changed or not six. Observe if it is a matter that you\\n\\nare fine with and are only afraid of other people's judgment or it is a matter that you also judge\\n\\nyourself for. So if you're also judging yourself for your action, see if you can change the behavior\\n\\nthat you don't like eight. If you're OK with your behavior, then ask yourself what consequences you\\n\\nmust pay to continue the behavior. If others judge you no, evaluate to see the consequence, you\\n\\nmust pay if you stop a behavior that you approve of and need it or like it due to the fear of other\\n\\npeople's judgment and observe to see if all is well and the fear is only a projection of a future that\\n\\nwould be fed. And if that's not your projection, then no one is actually OK. If you observe that you\\n\\nfind with your behavior values appearances and productivity and are only afraid of others opinion,\\n\\nthen trust yourself and move forward knowing that you cannot make everyone happy. If you receive\\n\\nnegative feedback from many people about your behavior, but you are still chosen to be a part of\\n\\nthis group, consider adjusting your behavior to remain in the community. But if the adjusting the\\n\\nbehavior is not possible or a choice, find a community that allows this type of value or behavior, if\\n\\nthere's a matter about you, that cannot be changed except yourself and focus on the areas of your\"),\n",

Have you ever felt disconnected? And even at times dissociated,\\n\\nmost people's answer is yes, they have being disconnected can happen due to a lack of interest in a\\n\\nsubject or a task. Or actually a person, usually when people get bored with the subject or lose\\n\\ninterest in the topic or if they don't agree with the subject or not interested in debating it, they take\\n\\ntheir attention away. It could be due to preoccupation with a subject, another subject. If someone is\\n\\nproblem solving, contemplating or analyzing, they tend to put their attention and energy fully on their\\n\\nmental task. So while they're sitting at a dinner table with the family or watching a movie, a part of\\n\\nthem is fully engaged in an internal process. Therefore, they're pretty much disconnected from their\\n\\nphysical space. Others disconnect due to being overwhelmed by an emotional uncomfortableness\\n\\nwith the situation. If there are conflicts they have to face. If they anticipate a fight or any form of\\n\\nemotional uproar, they tend to shy away and disconnect some disconnect due to attempting to\\n\\ncontrol their anger so that they don't lash out being physically and mentally tired will also create this\\n\\nconnection to preserve the small amount of energy that is left to handle their daily task. At times\\n\\nwhen disconnects from one thing that is fully present to another. And at times, there is a need to\\n\\ndisconnect from the outside world and just go with to recharge. Many use this connection from the\\n\\npart of their body as a form of pain management dissociation. On the other hand, is disconnection\\n\\nfrom one's body and self, which usually appears during the trauma when one has experienced utter\\n\\npowerlessness and helplessness, the anxiety of facing death, not being or being harmed, the pain in\\n\\nthe body from it being abused, assaulted, raped. All of those forces the person to disconnect from\\n\\ntheir body and at times from themselves, as they know it from the self who they know themselves as\\n\\nsome refuse to connect with their body. After trauma, they end up also harming or abusing their\\n\\nbody. Some even mutilate their own body parts to feel pain and remind themselves that this body is\\n\\ntheirs. The association is used as a coping mechanism to survive as long as the person is still living\\n\\nin a situation where abuse and trauma are going on. The association helps the person to hold on to\\n\\ntheir ego, strength and survive the situation. It's a way to prevent psychosis almost however,\\n\\ncontinues as an automatic way of existing. Even when the person no longer lives under those\\n\\nconditions, the younger the person and the length of the time that one has endured. A trauma\\n\\ndetermines the depth and severity of their dissociation healing. The trauma is the key to coming\\n\\nback to the body and therefore connecting with the present moment fully, I've had the privilege of\\n\\nworking 30 years with clients who have gone through traumas such as childhood, physical and\\n\\nemotional, mental and sexual abuse, worked with veterans reviving the actual war but not the one in\\n\\ntheir hat. The worst domestic awards which happens at home from your mate. It takes healing and\\n\\nintegrating the dissociated parts of the self for a person to fully experience livelihood and fulfillment\\n\\nin their life. There are times that disconnection is necessary. The disconnection and the distinction of\\n\\nwhen it is useful to be utilized versus disconnection. Being a to go to coping mechanism\\n\\nautomatically is important to live an intentional life where you can be present. Feel experience, life\\n\\nrequires you to be in your body, to be present, your presence, your attention, your interest, your\\n\\nwillingness to be open and receive all information are all necessary components.

Airing out your internal thought and\\n\\nemotions helps you declutter this reorganization and purging can open room for new healthy\\n\\nthoughts, emotions that would lead to healthy behaviors and the creation of healthy outcomes start\\n\\nwith breaking bad habits. Identify the habits that don't work for you anymore. Maybe is eating not\\n\\nright, exercising or not exercising, smoking, alcohol, um, getting overly angry, not being able to\\n\\nhandle your emotions, any of those or anything that you could imagine which, you know, is not\\n\\nworking for you. Tackle one habit at a time. Yes, we all have a lot more unhealthy habits that we can\\n\\nimagine. But let's do it, identify it, list it and let's take one at a time, prioritize the ones that you don't\\n\\nwant to do, observe and identify any triggers your triggers and how to eliminate them from your\\n\\nsurroundings, the ones that creates the bad habits. For example, if you think you drink too much,\\n\\nthen look at what triggers you. Is it the parties you, you're around, is it the alcohol that's around?\\n\\nWhatever you think that that would be the trigger, formulate what you like to replace it with and be\\n\\nclear about the goal and make it measurable, set a date to start with a new way of operating instead\\n\\nof the old habits. Journaling. It's wonderful because you get to be aware, you could go back, you\\n\\ncould look at it, it releases all of it. All of it is wonderful. So begin journaling. And then every evening\\n\\nas you write, take a blue pen and circle, all the negative thoughts and emotions. Now take another\\n\\npen, maybe a green pen and circle all the positive thoughts and emotions that you've already written\\n\\nand then begin cultivating a positive thought about each of the negative ones. If you felt like a victim\\n\\nin any situation, begin to see your power in what you have done and you have handled it, see what\\n\\nyou have learned and how you have become resilient, be aware of the stories that you attach to\\n\\npeople and different experiences versus the facts that are there. See the facts identify which one of\\n\\nthem are facts. Like if I took 10 other people there, they would see the same thing. And what part of\\n\\nit is your perception, your stories that you've assigned to it, give yourself a limited time to venture\\n\\nemotion. Don't uh create an emotional uproar. If the emotion comes in to see what the message is,\\n\\nvent it off and be done with it versus constantly cultivating it and pamper and nurture yourself\\n\\nbecause you deserve it. Now, declutter your physical space, start with one location or closet at a\\n\\ntime. Dec cluttering makes your anxiety go down and it just like because visually it's so pleasing to\\n\\nthe eye calms you down. Create a measurement rule for yourself. For example, if you have not used\\n\\nan item for one year or so, get rid of it as yourself. Is this item really useful? When was the last time\\n\\nthat I used it? Does it have emotional value? So it's not useful but it's useful to me because it\\n\\nreminds me of such and such a time which I had an amazing um time and I wanna cherish it. Can\\n\\nthat emotional value be assigned to something else or do you have to have all of these things that\\n\\nyou have memory about? Could you have one item that represents all of those memories for you?\\n\\nHow does keeping it make you feel? Does it make you feel like? Oh my God, I really, really want to\\n\\nhave this because it's I feel safe and I feel pleasure or if it's not there and I haven't seen it because\\n\\nit's in the closet. So it's not a really in my life. It's just once in a while. If I ever go to the closet, I know\\n\\nthat that's there. So if it's a feeling, a feeling of security and I want something, why is it in the closet\"),\n",

So if it's a feeling, a feeling of security and I want something, why is it in the closet\\n\\nthen? And if it's in the closet, maybe it no longer holds that value that needs to be there immediately.\\n\\nHow does letting it go make me feel? Right. So how does having it make me feel? How does letting\\n\\nit go make me feel? Can I replace it if I changed my mind and get help from a friend who is not\\n\\nattached to the items and um makes it easier because every time you're like, no, oh my God, I can't\\n\\nlet it go. A friend is like, come on please. You haven't touched this for three years. It's been in a box\\n\\nin an attic, let it go and then give away one item at a time to a friend or a charity. So this might help\\n\\nthe next one. Notice your relationships. What behaviors in your relationship do you choose to\\n\\nchange the behavior in an intimate relationship you're committing to change? And maybe, you know,\\n\\njust constantly complaining, constantly being angry. Um Maybe those are the things you want to\\n\\nchange in your relationship, the behavior or people in your friendship, you're committing to change\\n\\nthe behavior of people in your career or job you're committing to change the behavior in your\\n\\nfinances, you're committing to change the behavior and the way you treat yourself that you're\\n\\ncommitting to change. So write them all down and then next generate gratitude by making a list of\\n\\nthings that you're grateful for. Even if it appears small, begin each day by being grateful for all that is\\n\\nin front of you during the day, each night. Journal. About all the great opportunities for working,\\n\\nlearning and relating you have all day, appreciate your body, your character and the people in your\\n\\nlife allow the gift of forgiveness for yourself and people around you choose the person you commit to\\n\\nbeing with noticing your values and align your thoughts, emotions and behaviors with your values,\\n\\ncreate defined goals and set up your action plans in your calendar, set up structures with people\\n\\naround you to inspire and support you to reach your goal. So spring is here, welcome it with every\\n\\naspect of your being and um a newness and wishing you an amazing, amazing, amazing uh New\\n\\nYear, a new Spring.\"),\n",

Are you listening? Communication is the only bridge you have to another\\n\\nperson. Every individual lives in their own bubble, they take information from the world through their\\n\\nsenses, interpret it, predict, give meaning to it and then store it. Every individual also has desires,\\n\\nintentions, goals and acts toward gaining what they want each individual lives in many relationships\\n\\nand in many roles. So any interaction between individuals communicates a message from inside. I\\n\\nspoke with a couple that intends to love each other and have a close and intimate relationship. Yet\\n\\nthey go through defending coercing, manipulating and attacking each other as they talk. I talked to a\\n\\nwoman who shares her hatred and disgust toward her husband while she wants to keep her\\n\\nmarriage. I talked to a salesperson that intends to sell by a deadline and pushes and manipulates\\n\\nand bulldozes the buyer. I chat with the team who wants to get attention of another team that starts\\n\\nhumiliating them. And in front of other peers too. I talked to a young woman who wants to date and\\n\\nget married, but she acts as if she's not interested in anyone around for the fear of being rejected.\\n\\nThe congruence of your thoughts, feelings and actions, which will be your communication with\\n\\nothers with your intentions will have a favorable result. When any of those your thoughts, actions\\n\\nand feelings and intentions are out of alignment, the communication becomes confusing and\\n\\ntherefore irritating for others as well as yourself. Since you will not get the results you want, you will\\n\\nnot land that message. It's important to listen to yourself and become aware of what you want. What\\n\\nis the message you want to get? What do you want to create and then formulate what you want to\\n\\nsay. Listen to yourself very carefully. Since if there are any type of hidden agendas anywhere inside\\n\\nof you, it will show up, it'll show up in your body language. Yes, your body is always talking and\\n\\nrelaying so many messages. While you're only communicating 20% of the message verbally listen to\\n\\nyourself clearly and formulate what you want to communicate so that the non verbal and the verbal\\n\\nmessage becomes clear for the person you're communicating to. Since relationships are among\\n\\npeople, it's important to listen to the person you're relating to listen clearly to the words, the content,\\n\\nthe meaning, the nonverbal cues, the body language, tonality, emotions relate and intention of their\\n\\ncommunication. Reflect on what you heard to make sure that you got the message clearly and\\n\\naccurately. Just say is this what I heard from? You did I miss anything, share more with me and\\n\\nlisten. But if you're negotiating on anything, whether you are, you know, you're a couple married or\\n\\nin business, listen, for the desire of the person negotiating with you and state your desire clearly,\\n\\nthen align those two desires, which most times are probably different. And um so that both parties\\n\\nexperience being her respected, taken into account and or the winners feel like winners after the\\n\\nnegotiation, the more fulfilling your relationships are the happier you will be in life. And the only way\\n\\nthat your relationships can be fulfilling is with clear and authentic communication. These are the\\n\\nsteps, OK? Be authentic, be transparent. Listen to people reflect what you heard with compassion\\n\\nand listen to your intention, desire and needs. Share your request and negotiate with respect and\\n\\nhonor of both of you and all involved. And at the end, appreciate and hold gratitude and I appreciate\\n\\nyou for listening. For more observational integration skills. Go to my book Life Reset the awareness,\\n\\nintegration path to create the life you want. Thank you.\"),\n",

Change is inevitable. Yes, we all know it yet. It produces the most amount of\\n\\nanxiety for people. Change creates stress when the change is chosen and the future is expected\\n\\nsuch as moving up the academic ladder, getting the promotion and the company, getting married,\\n\\nhaving the child, any of those changes. Um They are still stressful. Even when change is chosen,\\n\\nthere are areas of unknown awaiting, that creates anxiety. There's also grief and mourning period to\\n\\nlet go of the status quo, whether you liked it or not. There's also the uncomfortableness and the\\n\\neffort of acquiring new behaviors and patterns while letting go of the old ones when change has not\\n\\nbeen chosen and it is forced upon such as being fired, laid off, being told that your partner is\\n\\nrequesting for a divorce, a war pandemic, illnesses. You know, all of those, the shock, the denial,\\n\\nthe resistance, anger, anxiety and the grief of losing what the person has become extremely hard,\\n\\nenvisioning a pleasurable future is gonna be resisting and at times even impossible. I've talked to\\n\\nsenior um in a high school who's going through the transition from childhood to adulthood, knowing\\n\\nthat he needs to say goodbye to all his friends who all will be going to different colleges across the\\n\\nnation. Anxious about moving to college away from home for the first time in his life, terrified of\\n\\ntaking care of himself without his parents being there all the time. I had a conversation with a woman\\n\\nafter 10 years of marriage, her husband left home in months of divorce. She is in the utmost grief\\n\\nstage, bargaining at times begs at times. He yells, pushes him away, cries all day and will not accept\\n\\nwhat is being proposed. She refuses to see a future without him and therefore cannot envision the\\n\\nfuture of herself. I spoke with a man who after three months of sobriety, after 10 years of being on\\n\\npainkillers and other types of opioids is terrified of living sober day to day and phases his emotional\\n\\ndisregulation. He misses his coping mechanism of numbing his feelings even though it was truly\\n\\nunhealthy. The future terrifies him. He does not see himself equipped to create a successful life. So\\n\\nhis anxiety, shame, hopelessness and helplessness pushes him away, goes back to relapse, even\\n\\nrelapse terrifies him. He feels stuck between a rock and a hard place of misery with change in any\\n\\ndirection. I spoke to a couple who are in love and are planning to move in together and get married.\\n\\nGreat plan. It's all a good change, right? They are both very anxious about how to adapt to each\\n\\nother's space temperament and needs. They're aware that they must negotiate all levels from\\n\\nadjust, adjusting to the bedroom temperature to all major financial decisions. The change is going\\n\\nfrom a single hood that allowed each of them to make solo decision about what made them\\n\\ncomfortable. The couple hood that requires for both to be happy and comfortable, the grief of losing\\n\\npersonal freedom to the anxiety of how far they must lose themselves to gain the US. Yes, change\\n\\nis inevitable. Change is happening every second whether you realize it or not. However, you're\\n\\nchoosing to be consistent with a belief or a behavior and that is why it appears constant. I wanna\\n\\nsay this again, change is happening every second whether you realize it or not. However, it is you\\n\\nthat's choosing to be consistent with a belief or a behavior that it makes it appears to be constant. It\\n\\nhas the delusion that is constant. You're not even breathing the same air every time you fill up your\\n\\nlungs, but it appears that you're consistently breathing the same way because you think that way\\n\\ninconsistency or change threatens our perceived sense of safety and security.

And the question is when my mood is down, how do I\\n\\nchange my mood to understand mood? Mood is a state that we have, which is our thought process,\\n\\nour emotions and our physiology. So we could attempt to shift either one of them in order to shift\\n\\nyour mood at that time. When it comes to the physiology, if you're anxious, uh walking, helps\\n\\njumping up and down, helps breathing. Um first allowing that breathing to leave and, and get out the\\n\\nanxiety or uh having deep breaths where it allows your body to see that I can be calm and um\\n\\neverything is ok. There's no danger if you're depressed, allowing yourself to walk, to move, to move\\n\\nyour body with music, to exercise, to do yoga. All of these physical changes, changing your\\n\\nphysiology will also impact changing your mood. When it comes to the emotion, you can feel your\\n\\nemotion wherever it is in your body, allow it to be there, experience it, name it and release it,\\n\\nreleasing by writing, releasing by crying, releasing by uh walking and shifting it into the physiology.\\n\\nUm and looking at what messages it has for you. It has a thought process, it has a logic around it\\n\\nand looking at what type of a thought process of belief, a formula, um a narrative, a story that you're\\n\\nrunning at that moment that allows that mood to get that way, whether it gets anxious or depressed\\n\\nand shifting, doing some reality check and shifting that element of the thought process. And um as\\n\\nyou do all three, where you shift the physiology and you access the emotion and name it and\\n\\nrelease it and you challenge in reality check your mood, you'll see that if your intention is to shift it by\\n\\nbeing with it, being intentional with it and uh shifting it, there's an ability for you to do that and gain\\n\\ncontrol over your mood.

Have you ever been humiliated publicly? It's an ouch. It really, really\\n\\nhurts. Um Imagine a student at school that gets a verbal or physical beating from a bully. Um, a\\n\\nwoman that gets ridiculed by her husband making a joke about marriage sucks. A man that gets put\\n\\ndown by his boss in a meeting, a child that gets scolded in public uh by his parents. Um, any of\\n\\nthose um a student that gets laughed at in school by their teacher, everyone can recall a moment\\n\\nwhen they felt belittled, humiliated, shamed, put down by someone in private or in front of others. It\\n\\nproduces a lot of extreme emotions such as shame, sadness, powerlessness, disgust, anxiety, and\\n\\nmore than any other rage. His emotions lead to the person wanting and needing to isolate. They\\n\\nwant height at times to retaliate or revenge, generalized thoughts such as not fair. How dare you?\\n\\nWhat's wrong with me? The world is not safe. I will get back at you. I'm not important. Um I'm no\\n\\ngood people are bad. Can't be trusted or this always happens to me. Any of those or similar to those\\n\\ncan flutter consciousness. Humiliation is stated as the a basement of pride which creates\\n\\nmortification or leads to a state of being humble or reduced to lowliness or submission. You feel low.\\n\\nIt is an emotion felt by a person whose social status, either by force or willingly has just decreased to\\n\\nhumiliate. Someone is stated as making someone feel ashamed and foolish by injuring their dignity\\n\\nand self-respect specially publicly. In most cases, it appears that someone is doing a deliberate act.\\n\\nHowever many times, it's not even deliberate and could be a superior stance in up to down position\\n\\nwhile rejecting an idea, a behavior or a person in couples, their micro aggression shows up as\\n\\nsarcastic remarks in a safe family setting where they feel safe to share their anger. However, its\\n\\nimpact is humiliating their spouse publicly, which in most cases, the favor will be reciprocated by the\\n\\nbelittled spouse. What can we do since we all experience it once in a while? Um How you can\\n\\nhandle the situation? First of all, think about it, you're not alone. Almost everyone has had a similar\\n\\nexperience one way or another. If you know of people who have had similar experiences, share your\\n\\nupset. It's a common experience and you can see what other people have um worked in healing\\n\\nthemselves in a sense. It may not be person, the person who usually belittles people does it to most\\n\\npeople around them. It's either a part of their character strategy they use to gain control or they're so\\n\\nself centered that they're oblivious to the impact of their behavior. And I've met all sorts. Yes, this\\n\\ntime was you? It's not about you. It's about them. But yes, you were impacted by it. It's a different\\n\\nfeel when you think about it, that all that person did it to me. So therefore it's my issue versus they\\n\\nare that way. And yes, it became my issue and I can take care of myself in any format that I can just\\n\\nto see if you need to handle the matter or move on from it. If the relationship or the circumstance is\\n\\na way that you may not avoid it and must continue seeing that person as a spouse, a member of a\\n\\nfamily at work at school, you may need to assess mechanisms of it to address this matter to prevent\\n\\nit from happening again. However, if it's a situation that you no longer need to be with a friends\\n\\ngroup, a hobby group, you're at a store and somebody talks that way, you're driving and somebody\\n\\ndoes that, you may choose to just be out and move on and don't bother yourself with getting into a\\n\\nfight or a war with that person. See what you'll learn from this experience. This is how you put\\n\\nyourself in this situation. You may have observed this person behaving this way toward others and\\n\\nyou thought never happened to me, I'm special and observed where you did not set boundaries for\\n\\nthe people who are around you so that this might happen or that when it happened once, can you\"),\n",

Reconsider revenge? It's best to act according to your highest\\n\\nvalue rather than strike back with from vengeance. You may want to stop the drama versus igniting\\n\\nmore and more for the future. Remember you get into the mud, you're gonna get money. It's\\n\\nsomething that you enjoy. It's up to you to choose. But usually with a person who has belittled you, if\\n\\nthey did it on purpose, they're gonna play that game. So you're just putting yourself in a war that\\n\\neven if you win, you wasted a lot of the time proving to someone something that necessarily doesn't\\n\\nmatter to them. If it was just a matter of setting a boundary, you could probably set a boundary in so\\n\\nmany other way versus revenge and don't waste your time on it and your energy and your anger\\n\\nand your peace isolation may support you. Only in the short term, many people tend to want to hide\\n\\nand isolate for short periods of time. Removing yourself from what is happening is a great idea\\n\\nbecause it minimizes repeated hurtful conversation. However, be cautious of long term isolated\\n\\nbehavior because it can lead to depression or you also be cautious that if you are isolating yourself,\\n\\nit is only supposed to be a break. And within that time it's for you to calm yourself down and heal\\n\\nyourself versus go into isolation and brew rage and hatred and anger because that's just gonna hurt\\n\\nyour body and your psyche move on with what you love staying and rehashing the same scenario\\n\\nonly fuels your emotions. You could keep rehashing it with other friends and gossip and do all of\\n\\nthat. But all that it's doing is brewing negativity in your rage and you're gonna get sick, leave it alone,\\n\\nassess what you need to do with the scenario and move on to projects you love people who love\\n\\nyou people you love and the ones who cherish you and just heal yourself. We all survive humiliation.\\n\\nIt makes us stronger and more resilient. It makes us humble and it teaches a lesson to protect\\n\\nourselves from people who may be toxic. Mark Twain said it's best keep away from people who try\\n\\nto belittle your, your ambition, small people always do that.

This week, I've been working on the notion of success and failure. Both\\n\\nsuccess and failure have a reality based and a perceptual com component. When we intend on\\n\\ncreating a result in our life, we visualize it, act toward implementing the result. If we manifested the\\n\\nresult, we said we were gonna do, we call it a success. If the result does not match what we\\n\\nvisualize previously, we declare it a failure at times, the result we create might appear as a success\\n\\nto other people around us. It could match a society or an industry's measurements and standards. It\\n\\ncould have been someone else's dream. So they see our result as a success. But if it doesn't match\\n\\nour previously intended vision, we feel a lack, a disappointment and a shame. We might assume\\n\\nthat we are a failure. Less than never good enough or just enough, nothing better than enough,\\n\\nwhich still feels like a failure. There's a distinction between succeeding or failing on one task or\\n\\nproject um or holding on as an identity as a success or a failure. When um someone assigns this\\n\\ntype of an identity such as I am a failure after they succeed or fail at one project. Some wait for\\n\\nseveral results before they declare themselves as one of the other. Right? Couple of failures and\\n\\nthen I am an actual failure. Usually people wait for several results to get favorable feedback from\\n\\nothers in the family and community before feeling like they are a success, not just they succeeded\\n\\non one project, but they are a success. Some only see themselves as a success when they meet\\n\\nthe industry or the society's success standards. Some may never feel or state that they are a\\n\\nsuccess, regardless of others. Holding them as a space of success. Failure takes a toll on people's\\n\\nemotional well being, some could be a success in the eye of others and yet see themselves as a\\n\\ntotal failure. Some suffer by only focusing on what they don't have while there's so much to be\\n\\nappreciated about. Some hold the fantasy that if all is not perfect, then it is considered a failure.\\n\\nSome expect to be successful and will not tolerate getting the result. They want some think that they\\n\\nare doomed by failure since they're not smart enough, fast enough, pretty enough. Just any enough.\\n\\nThis week, I experienced not achieving the result that I wanted only as a project that did not work\\n\\namong so many other ones that did no other labels were necessary. The post even analysis can be\\n\\nof, oh, how come didn't work? Why didn't it work? What was not done for it to create the result?\\n\\nWhat was missing so that the result was not gained? How did it impact others? What did I learn from\\n\\nit? How can it be authentically shared and explained to others what can be done in the future? So I\\n\\ndon't create the same result. What skills I didn't have? And I really need it for next time as I'm doing\\n\\nthis project so that I can create success. These are the questions that you actually need to ask\\n\\nyourself instead of labeling yourself consistently, right? What didn't work? What was not done? What\\n\\nwas missing that I got this result instead of the one I wanted, how did it impact myself and others\\n\\nwho were part of the project? And what did I learn? What was learned out of all of us? And how can\\n\\nit be authentically shared with others and explained to others most of the time what we do, we try to\\n\\nlie about it, minimize it, excuse it, justify it somehow do something with it instead of just saying,\\n\\nyeah, this project didn't work and uh explain it in the way of answering the questions we just talked\\n\\nabout and what can be done in the future. And the skills are actually looking at the future versus the\\n\\npast and getting caught because most of the people who go through that they keep getting caught in\\n\\nthe past instead of moving toward the future.

This week we lost Miss USA 2019 Chesley Crest to suicide. This news\\n\\nbrought the seriousness of depression and high rates of suicide to surface again. Suicide is the 10th\\n\\nleading cause of death in the United States. It is the fourth leading cause of death for adolescent\\n\\nages 15 to 19. Globally. The major risk factors for suicide behavior are mental health and substance\\n\\nuse disorders. Suicide risk may also be increased by environmental factors such as stressful life\\n\\nevents and access to lethal tools such as firearms or drugs. Suicide attempts in the past and a\\n\\nfamily history of suicide are both significant risk factors. In the past week, I have been talking to\\n\\nmany people regarding their state of depression. One successful woman told me that she is so\\n\\nbubbly and up that when she's talking with her friends or at work that no one, no one would ever\\n\\nbelieve that when she comes home, she goes into this dark well, in a dark place and all she wants is\\n\\nfor her world to end. Another 40 year old woman told me that if I had an easy and unavailable\\n\\nmeans for committing suicide at home. One of my impulses during the night of wishing to be dead,\\n\\nwould I would act on it? But luckily my rational blame shows up and when I want to plan it, talk\\n\\nmyself out of it, I also spoke with a 17 year old teen who questions life, God and the purpose of\\n\\nliving in this punitive world. And as he embarks to says, his journey toward adulthood goes into a\\n\\ndeep dark depression. Depression feels dark, hard, filled with pain and deep. It might be due to a\\n\\nbiological factor being born into a family. Genetics of one of the parents being depressed, living in a\\n\\ndepressed family environment, living in a society that is going through depression due to poverty,\\n\\nwar and natural disaster, childhood, physical trauma, sexual traumas living under harsh, abusive or\\n\\nneglectful parenting style life circumstances, poverty, mental illness, physical illness, hormonal\\n\\nimbalance, unemployment, financial burden, face a life issue and many more. Although the rights of\\n\\npeople with depression are not subsidy, there are still reports of many people who are getting better.\\n\\nTheir depression rate is less or at least the period of period and what some treatments actually\\n\\nabsolves it's important to get help, to be diagnosed appropriately and to be treated accordingly. So\\n\\nfar, medical management includes antidepressants and new psychedelic treatments such as\\n\\nketamine, psilocybin and MD MA for PTSD only in clinical settings. The neurological treatments\\n\\ninclude cranial electrostimulation therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, therapies and neuron\\n\\nfeedbacks and psychotherapy, which is essential for treating depression. There are many\\n\\napproaches from cognitive behavioral therapy, emotional, the focus therapy, behavioral therapy, eye\\n\\nmovement desensitization, and reprocessing for PTSD and even hypnosis. Now, the awareness\\n\\nintegration therapy is a multi is a multiple published um research and uh multimodality uh\\n\\npsychological and educational model which has shown that it minimizes depression. Since with the\\n\\nawareness integration theory, the person reviews their roles, thoughts feelings actions, dualities,\\n\\nparadoxes story storylines in all areas of their life, they are then able to challenge and bring about\\n\\nsubstantial paradigm shift and therefore action oriented skills to deal with life. As is they can also\\n\\nsee their strengths and resilience to be brought to surface and operate from an empowerment in a\\n\\nday to day life. So seek support. If you feel depressed, you deserve to live a happy life and be\\n\\nfulfilled. For more observational and integration skills get by book life, reset the awareness\\n\\nintegration path to create the life you want. Thank you.\"),\n",

I just read a statement on social media from someone who with lots of anger\\n\\nand resentment, questioned self love, loving another and love of higher power. I read other people's\\n\\ncomments about how people explained what love is to them, depending on the tonality and the\\n\\ncontent. The words that were used in the message I perceived how much a person was being\\n\\nresentful of love and was getting angry that others were enjoying love or fostering love, working with\\n\\ncouples for more than 30 years has revealed how the capacity of feeling and experiencing love\\n\\nallows one to receive it or avoid it, deny it defy it or even fight with it. This capacity of experiencing\\n\\nlove shows itself in our friendships, romantic relationships, marriages, parenthood, social and\\n\\npolitical views and actions. Our first experience of love is with our primary caretaker or someone\\n\\nwho lives with us. Like our mom, my dad, grandparents, elders, siblings, nanny, or someone dear to\\n\\nus. Next, we experienced love from our extended family members, neighbors, teachers, and\\n\\nsomeone in the community that cares for us as a mentor, as we go to school, we experience the\\n\\nlove of friends. We fight over friendships. We create alliances, we have best friends and we keep\\n\\neach other secrets and form long lasting relationships which truly matters to us from our teen years.\\n\\nUh We experience romantic love, get attached, get dumped, get territorial, get rejected, rejected\\n\\nothers, experience euphoria and then painful heartaches. As we become young adults, we learn that\\n\\nwe need relational skills to foster, initiate regenerate, express and receive love from our mates. We\\n\\ngrow with having Children and experiencing love in a whole new dynamic with responsibility,\\n\\ncreativity, play, mentorship, purpose and much more as we grow older and our Children grow up,\\n\\nthe love extends itself to our community and so on. When someone has received and experienced\\n\\nlove in the various phases of life, they know it, they feel it, they recognize it have the capacity to hold\\n\\nit and can give and express love. However, if someone has not had the opportunity to experience\\n\\nlove from their childhood era, one might feel awkward, suffocated, anxious, burdened or even fearful\\n\\nof love, the relationship might become transactional and void of the notion of love. They might\\n\\nridicule the notion of love and whoever requests it from that they might run away and they're offered\\n\\nlove as if it were a rope that would capture and then burden them some, get lucky and meet\\n\\nsomeone who offers a safe, unconditional love and acceptance and has the patience to wade\\n\\nthrough all the ups and downs of the person until they test the love enough to finally trust the\\n\\nexperience and become fulfilled by it. Usually, when we have not experienced love, it is also difficult\\n\\nto love ourselves. We might use our body or even abuse our body, punish ourselves and be on a\\n\\npath of destruction. Psychotherapy or coaching offers a space for a person to first experience\\n\\nacceptance of self and others and opens their horizon to love, love of self, others and beyond the\\n\\nessence of life is love. So don't hold back live with love for more observational skills to see your\\n\\npatterns about love. Get my book to Life, reset the awareness, integration path to create the life you\\n\\nwant.

The concept of\\n\\ntaking a break has become a novelty. Most of the structures that were set for us by the society\\n\\nschool and work arena have changed. So how can we give ourselves a break? In recent survey,\\n\\npeople have reported that a high level of unemployment is due to people being just burned out.\\n\\nThey quit because they're burned out of what they were doing and how they were doing it. I work\\n\\nwith couples who work from home and their hours of work have turned into 16 hours or all day\\n\\nversus the time they went into the office. I work with a mother whose Children are schooling from\\n\\nhome due to the pandemic and have lost all her hours to handle the Children, studying and\\n\\nmonitoring as well as cooking, cleaning and all of it. I also work with a gentleman that is at work, but\\n\\nsince many of his coworkers are ill, he must do overtime to pull all the load. I work with a career\\n\\nwoman, a mom, a wife who thinks that being home has its own set of work. So the only time she\\n\\ngets a break is five minutes before laying down on her bed and falling asleep. I work with a\\n\\ncorporate CEO who sees his brace as time for him to handle his email for all of his family. Business\\n\\nmatters. So taking a break is an essential need. Not just the far fetched idea of luxury means taking\\n\\nthe time for yourself, paying attention to your body, quieting your mind, experiencing pleasure,\\n\\nhaving fun, just for sake of having fun and playing, allowing yourself to balance life with an ample\\n\\nnumber of meaningful breaks. It reduces physical and mental stress, anxiety, depression, improved\\n\\nmood with um higher levels of positive thoughts and emotions resulting in higher self esteem and\\n\\nconfidence. Recreational activities also reduce cortisol levels. Blood pressure and heart rate breaks\\n\\ncan give you a boost in mindfulness. Looking at the bigger picture, not sweating, the small stuff,\\n\\nreducing mental fatigue and motivation and a renewed focus on the task that we got stuck at or less\\n\\nagile at. You deserve to take a guilt free break. Yes, a guilt free break. Walk in the park. Watch your\\n\\nfavorite sitcom. Listen to music. Do a little bit on a piece of paper paint, draw, play with clay pottery,\\n\\nexercise, yoga, meditation, chat with a friend. Have a cup of coffee while you enjoy it. You know the\\n\\nnature outside of your window, take a 20 minute nap. Listen to a piece of Binaural beat music,\\n\\ndance with your favorite music. Play with your pet. Have sex, cook, eat a fun healthy meal. Get a\\n\\nmassage. Tai chi play pantomime or the front. Make a short movie from your pictures. Take a photo\\n\\nof nature jigsaw puzzle. Play a video game, write a short story. Go to a movie, go to a stand up\\n\\ncomedy. Zip line kayak play sports, run, get on a swing, reorganize your closet, rearrange your\\n\\nfurniture, go window shopping, color your hair for fun. Play cards with your friends, learn magic,\\n\\nlearn to juggle balls and learn a new language blog or whatever else. Your heart desires allow your\\n\\nbreaks to be intentional. Pay attention to your body, insist, insist on feeling joy and pleasure within\\n\\nthat time. The purpose is for you to take your focus off what you are doing and attend to another\\n\\nhigher order need. Studies show that productivity rises when life is balanced, you will feel all around\\n\\nfulfillment when your life is balanced with meaningful productivity, as well as lots of physical and\\n\\nmental intriguing fun. So schedule your breaks in your calendar. The same way you schedule your\\n\\nwork and commitments, honor yourself, you deserve it. And for more observational skills and\\n\\nintegration of skills, go to my book, Life Reset the Awareness Integration Path to the life you want.\\n\\nThank you.\"),\n",

It's important for us to forgive ourselves\\n\\nfor all that. We think we have done wrong for a part of our character or the way our body is,\\n\\nforgiveness of self is much harder than forgiveness of others at times. Why should we forgive\\n\\nourselves? Because it frees us. It frees us from anger from resentment, depression, self loathing,\\n\\nself blaming and pretty much self punishment. Why is it so hard to forgive um ourselves? We might\\n\\nhold ourselves to a higher standard than other people. We might not trust that we will not do the\\n\\nunforgettable, unforgivable act again in the future, we might think that we have no control. We might\\n\\nsee the problem as not changeable or fixable. I've spoken with a man who was addicted, did not\\n\\nspend time with his son and his son refused to talk to him. He can't bring the past back to change\\n\\nthe course of their relationship. So he's angry at himself for creating this result. And since he's facing\\n\\nthe loss daily, he can't forgive himself. I talked to a woman who had an abortion and feels guilty\\n\\nabout not having a child. Since daily she faces the lack of the child in her present moment. She can't\\n\\nforgive herself for making that decision no matter how many times she goes back and looks at the\\n\\nreality of why she did what she did and she made the right decision for that time. But today, her um\\n\\nher needs have changed and because her age does not allow her to have Children that desire, she\\n\\nneeds to mourn for the rest of her life. I spoke with a young woman whose body shape is not up to\\n\\npar with what passion allows. So she can't forgive herself for not taking care of her body as a teen\\n\\nand feels powerless to change herself. So she contributes to this matter to not um this, this matter\\n\\ngets contributed because you can't get a date or go into a relationship. Others I've spoken to that\\n\\ncan't forgive themselves for passing opportunities of a lifetime, having affairs or acting in a way that\\n\\nthey lost relationships that they can't bring back. It's hard sometimes to go back and have\\n\\ncompassion for yourself, especially if you're consistently having to pay the consequences of some of\\n\\nthe decisions you make happens to all of us. So how do we forgive ourselves? Let's own it first, you\\n\\ncan take responsibility and be accountable for the part that you did in creating a result that was not\\n\\nfavorable for you. You may have made a mistake or consciously done an act to get a particular\\n\\noutcome that was only beneficial to you either way. In the long term, the results didn't turn out the\\n\\nway you wanted and it didn't turn out in your favor. Let's see if this is a matter of the past or the\\n\\npresent moment. If it's a matter of the past something you've done before or caused, um, hurt and\\n\\nharm to someone, can that relationship be repaired? Can you clear and clean up with that person?\\n\\nCan you communicate your remorse and make a new commitment? All of these lessons, the guilt\\n\\nfeeling that you carry for a lifetime, you can realize that at the time of any incident, you made a\\n\\ndecision and acted upon the available information at the hand at hand at that time. And in the\\n\\npresent moment, you have a broader perspective in hindsight, every everything looks different, but\\n\\nyou might have to go back and really see what were the conditions at the time you made those\\n\\ndecisions. And if you looked at all the aspects, you might see that at that moment, that was still\\n\\nprobably the best possible choice with the information you had at that time or there was a desire and\\n\\nthere was a need that needed to be fulfilled at that time, that just wasn't gonna be fulfilled any other\\n\\nway. Although maybe your logic said it's not ok, but the emotional need did what it needed to do.\\n\\nTreat yourself the same way that you would treat a friend who made a mistake. Sometimes we're so\\n\\nmuch more compassionate with others and forgive them, but just don't do it to us, evaluate the\"),\n",

Sometimes we're so\\n\\nmuch more compassionate with others and forgive them, but just don't do it to us, evaluate the\\n\\nstandards that you would hold for others and compare them with the standards you're upholding for\\n\\nyourself. Treat yourself as you would treat others. Actually, probably with a hell of a lot more\\n\\ncompassion. Evaluate the realm of your responsibility for the incident. See how far it was you doing\\n\\nand what was the line when others were also responsible for whatever happened? Only take\\n\\nownership of what you created and dropped the load that was not you're doing. This includes not\\n\\nholding yourself responsible for other people's emotions or thoughts as well as their actions. Don't\\n\\nattach a negative general label or meaning about yourself because of some mistakes or action such\\n\\nas I'm such a failure that I will always screw up. I'm in a screw up all the time. I'm such a liar. I'm this\\n\\nor that when you make this type of generalization about yourself, you will feel powerless and\\n\\nhopeless. You're more than one action or a mistake. You are also the person who learns from your\\n\\nmistakes or mishaps and can't make them a better decision. Write a letter from the part that needs\\n\\nto be forgiven to you, acknowledging what needs to be forgiven and the sense of genuine remorse,\\n\\nthen write to the part of yourself that you need to forgive as if it is a dear friend, acknowledge the\\n\\nlearning what you've learned already. See the strength and the resiliency of that part and the growth\\n\\nthat came from all of that experience and commit to loving and integrating toward wholeness, set\\n\\nvalues for yourself to uphold that you can be proud of and live them daily.

There's a surge in the I don't feel good experience due to the\\n\\ndifferent strands of COVID-19 flu or simple cold. People react differently to being sick, having to\\n\\ncancel their plans or work. Some people feel relieved that they can just stay home and go guilt free.\\n\\nI can take care of myself and um some people get very agitated for having to miss work or social\\n\\nevents. Others get angry at their body for getting sick, some get angry at others and the world for\\n\\ngetting them sick. Some think that they have so much to do. They can't afford to be sick and some\\n\\nliterally can't afford to get sick due to financial restraint and not having the ability to go to work. So\\n\\nthere is the illness itself and then all the thoughts and emotions around the illness that is different for\\n\\nus. Any illness comes with its own set of discomfort and management. However, how we deal with\\n\\nan illness is the subject that I like to ponder. We may think that our body is not us and it is this object\\n\\nor a vehicle that is not working and we get irritated at it as if our car had a problem and it is creating\\n\\ndiscomfort and an inconvenience for us. So we continue to be agitated at it for not working properly\\n\\nas it should. We may even punish it by withholding nutrition from it or even abusing it with unhealthy\\n\\nfood, drugs or alcohol. For many who have been physically or sexually abused or mistreated, it may\\n\\nbe hard to even live in their bodies. I've worked with people who recall lifting off from their bodies\\n\\nwhen they were being hit or sexually molested. They never felt the same about their bodies. Many\\n\\nathletes learned to use their bodies for their sport and saw it only as a vehicle to win a trophy for\\n\\nthem. Others were ashamed of their bodies not being perfect or an attractive one, whether they\\n\\nwere too thin or too fat or too tall or too short or just disfigured somehow and not to par with the\\n\\nlatest fashion and therefore they decided to abandon the body and punish it some act if who I am is\\n\\nin the head and the body starts from my neck down, but try to numb the brain with alcohol to drugs\\n\\nanyway, some want to numb it all so that they just don't feel discomfort or pain and end up numbing\\n\\nall of their emotions if we could view our body as part of the self, an amazing gift and the base of our\\n\\noperating system, then we will value it more. We sense the outside world through our bodies. We\\n\\nfeel our emotions through our bodies. We get to be alive because of our bodies. So let's honor\\n\\nourselves as our body and our psyche, even for the ones who believe that their soul is different than\\n\\ntheir bodies in this lifetime. On earth, they only got one. They only get to be experiencing being on\\n\\nthe earth through this body. I want to share this simple meditation with you. OK. So sit comfortably,\\n\\num close your eyes if you're not driving, if you're not driving, if you are, don't worry about just watch\\n\\nthe front of, watch front of you and then listen, begin breathing deeply into the bottom of your\\n\\nstomach and inhaled the count of four and then hold count of four and exhale to the count of four\\n\\nand then continue deep breathing and extend the exhale.

And as you\\n\\ncontinue breathing deeply, just concentrate on extending your exhale and begin concentrating on\\n\\nyour feet and toes and state your gratitude like I love you and thank you for being with me. Thank\\n\\nyou for helping me walk, holding my balance and facilitating me moving around. Is there anything I\\n\\ncan do for you? Is there anything you need from me?

Actually happy 2022. This time of the year\\n\\nbrings a space for promises to be fulfilled. Space of great probabilities and potentialities. It's time to\\n\\ncreate intentions and manifest them. It's important to become aware of your thoughts, feelings and\\n\\nbeliefs that could hold you back from what you can envision for yourself. Some people are afraid of\\n\\nenvisioning big outcomes due to thinking negative thoughts such as I don't deserve it. It will never\\n\\nhappen. I will fail and it would be very embarrassing. Others would laugh at me. I don't know how to\\n\\neven get there. Some people only look at all the things that they don't want to happen but don't\\n\\nfocus on what they want to create. Now, imagine, imagine you have all the resources and all the\\n\\nskills in the world with no limitations. What would you imagine having allow your imaginations to soar\\n\\nand bathe in the beauty of the vision, feel deserving of it. The notion of you deserving to have what\\n\\nyou envision is different than realistically making it possible by the end of 2022. With the skills and\\n\\nresources that you have at this time. But first we start with you knowing that if you imagine that you\\n\\ndeserve it, if you imagine that you deserve it, I imagine who do you need to be to manifest your\\n\\nvision. Now, let's look at your vision and see what is possible and probable with your level of\\n\\nresources and skills. Get very specific with your vision. Check your feelings as you envision\\n\\nobtaining and reaching your goals. Check for all the negative and limiting beliefs that might show up\\n\\nagain, challenge the unfounded beliefs. Keep going through these steps until you have a clear vision\\n\\nof your intentions and goals for the year 2022 create a collage and put it all the pictures of your\\n\\nupcoming manifestations on the large piece of paper and hang it where you could see it daily, share\\n\\nit with your community so they can support you with actualization. So now I'm gonna share some of\\n\\nmy vision for 2022 for your blessing, good wishes and support. So I intend to have the awareness\\n\\nintegration theory of a global reach of 5 million people through the Fujian app. The app is coming\\n\\nout this year certifying more than 1000 therapists and coaches globally to share this work with their\\n\\nclients for intentional parenting book, which is bringing the awareness integration theory into\\n\\nparenting, written with two of my great colleagues, Doctor Jeffery and Doctor Manookian to be\\n\\npublished by Cambridge Scholars. I'm committed to operating on a higher vibration of love on a daily\\n\\nbasis with my friends, family clients and all all of you. And I'm committed to being mentally and\\n\\nphysically healthy and I intend to be abundantly prosperous and generous, financially, emotionally\\n\\nand spiritually.

This time of the year brings joy, love, connectedness and festivity for many,\\n\\nmany, many people. For some, this is a time to face their loneliness for others. It's time to face\\n\\nunhealthy relationships with loved ones or family. You may feel lonely when you disconnect from\\n\\neveryone around you. There are more than 7 billion people on the face of this earth that you can\\n\\nconnect to and remember they're there waiting to be connecting with you. You may have\\n\\ndisconnected from yourself and therefore not connected with anybody else. You may be judging\\n\\nothers or you may be judging yourself with drawing, closing up, avoiding avoiding connection and\\n\\num as a result, feeling lonely, you may want to have the special person who's not there and then\\n\\nkind of forget about all the other people who are out there for you. You may be trying to protect\\n\\nyourself by disconnecting so that it won't be that you won't be harmed and then you won't be hurt\\n\\nand yet harming yourself by isolating.

Even if you're not feeling close to them and maybe it's\\n\\nsomebody that's on the street, maybe it's someone that you get coffee from, maybe it's your\\n\\nneighbor. Maybe it's just opening your heart and seeing somebody smile who really wants to\\n\\nconnect with you. So if you're not closed off from receiving, there might be a lot of people out there\\n\\nthat wanna connect, focus on all the people that you're impacting or inspiring every day and you\\n\\ndon't even notice, focus on all the people who rely on you and maybe you could see how valuable\\n\\nyou are.

Whoever you think\\n\\nis the best version of you become aware of your thoughts and feelings as you're preparing to be with\\n\\nyour family, um be watchful of how you may be interacting with your family members from the past\\n\\nfixed history, not giving yourself or them a chance to show up differently. Be conscious of your\\n\\ntriggers and how you automatically might find yourself reacting to what is not really there, but only in\\n\\nyour mind. Watch for the triggers that come up due to reactions of your family members and then\\n\\nyou react to them is an interaction that you can be proud of the next day. At least from your side.\\n\\nObviously, you have no control over them. Like, you know, when the next day you kind of recall and\\n\\nrehash what happened, even if it was hurtful, even if it was uncomfortable. But you could say I did\\n\\nmy best and it was ok. Like I'm proud of if I rerun that whole concept of, you know, the whole night.\\n\\nReally, I'm OK. I had to do it over again. You know, this is the way I would do it because again, I did\\n\\nmy best. Remember, this is a time to connect to you, cherishing yourself, shedding all old, unwanted\\n\\nand unworkable habits, allowing love to flourish you. Yes, to flourish you and choosing healthier\\n\\nhabits that work for you. Just sit down, meditate, go over every part of your body, like your hair, your\\n\\nface, your neck, your eyes, your nose, your ears, your mouth, your chin, all of it, go over your neck\\n\\nand appreciate every part. Appreciate your eyes for seeing in your ears, for hearing and your mouth,\\n\\nfor tasting amazing and for your um th for breathing in amazing aromas and giving your life with a\\n\\nbreathing, go back with um their hands, their arms, forgetting you things.

If you're disconnected from this body you're not\\n\\ngonna feel.

But remember when\\n\\nyou close down all the feelings, you're closing down all all the good ones too. All the ones that you\\n\\nactually enjoy and yearned for. So open up your heart, get connected to your body, feel the feelings\\n\\nand choose to feel joy. Choose to feel happy, choose to feel calm, bring up those feelings. Yes, you\\n\\ncan, you can bring those up. Imagine being in a place, being with people who bring you the joy and\\n\\nthe love and the calmness and serenity and then stop feeling them in your heart and let the spirit of\\n\\nthe holiday bring you generosity of love and kindness to yourself, your surrounding and everyone\\n\\nwho's around you, whether you're sitting home beside a fireplace and, um, kind of being with\\n\\nyourself, you don't even need to call it, being alone, be with yourself. Enjoy yourself, read an\\n\\namazing book, watch a great movie that you've never had. And if you are with people then connect\\n\\nto them, heart to heart, cherish them, have the gratitude. Let them know how much you appreciate\\n\\nhaving them in your life and how much you're grateful for everything that you've ever learned from\\n\\nthem and everything you've had the opportunity to share with them, from your heart and from your\\n\\nexperiences that could have been very, very useful for them. So be authentic and be you. I enjoy it\\n\\nalso. We're going to the next year. So maybe it's also a week that you can start looking at if I was\\n\\ngoing to do the spring cleaning in the winter. And if I was going to have the opportunity to kind of let\\n\\ngo of some of the stuff that I don't want to. Let's do it. Let's first go into our closet, go over all of the\\n\\nclothes that you think I haven't worn for a year. They're not my shape anymore. They're not my taste\\n\\nanymore. Um, they're not in my fashion anymore. Put them together and donate them. Give them to\\n\\nsomeone who still enjoys them and uh could really, really wear them with a joy and love. Um, go\\n\\nover all of your shoes and the ones that don't look good anymore or don't fit. Let them go either give\\n\\nthem as a gift or they're not gift worthy anymore and you utilize them as much as you could, then let\\n\\nthem go. So let go of everything that is out there that kind of belongs to you, but it's just no longer\\n\\nworking for you. And then let's start sitting down and looking the thought process that shows up for\\n\\nyou. Let's take a whole week in journal every day to really get to know your own thought process.\\n\\nWhat do you think about, what are some of the limiting beliefs or your beliefs are actually limiting it?\\n\\nWhat are some of the beliefs and thought process that just enrages you get you angry, feels\\n\\npowerless, um creates guilt. It's shame any of those emotions then evaluate those beliefs. Is there\\n\\nanything you need to do with them? Is there anything you need to come clean? Is there anything\\n\\nthat um you have remorse and you need to go clean up? Is there anything that is there that? No, no,\"),\n",

Is there anything you need to come clean? Is there anything\\n\\nthat um you have remorse and you need to go clean up? Is there anything that is there that? No, no,\\n\\nmaybe it wasn't even yours. Maybe it just kind of inherited and then kept subscribing to it. It's not\\n\\nreally yours. You don't even need to keep them anymore. Let's look at all the relationships,\\n\\nrelationship at work, the relationship with your family, with your parents, with your siblings, with um\\n\\nyour mate, your Children, your neighbors, your community. What part of these relationships are you\\n\\nflourishing, expanding, bringing light and love to which part of these relationships you're being\\n\\ngreedy and um maybe not best of you going there, maybe jealousy, envy, um kind of like your ego is\\n\\nat hand. Uh Maybe righteousness is there and it's not developing good relationship for you. So let's\\n\\nlook at those relationships and see if you were gonna be the best of it, but you are gonna be really\\n\\nproud. What would you change in any of those from your side? Because obviously you have um no\\n\\nsaying about how they're gonna change it, you can request it but you won't be able to control it.\\n\\nWhat part of you your thought process, your words, your latent, this you would like to upgrade, let's\\n\\nsay so that you could have relationships that foster love and kindness and connection and\\n\\ncooperativeness together. So let's look at all of those, let's look at how you think of yourself. And um\\n\\nif you're being harsh, if you're being punitive and maybe those don't work anymore and how could\\n\\nyou be loving and still hold yourself in a space where you could move forward and um be motivated\\n\\nand create it and co create, create and co create um the best life that you could ever have. And if\\n\\nyou see that there are belief systems and thought process that just don't work in that area about\\n\\nMiss South. Oh, I shut them. You don't need to give this to anybody else could just dump them and\\n\\nthen start looking at what type of thought process and believes would actually make you grow, make\\n\\nyou expand, make you just be proud, confident and uh wanna grow. And what in the world will give\\n\\nyou this concept of? Oh, wow, I'm excited. I'm excited in being that. I'm excited to learn that I'm\\n\\nexcited to expand as that. Well, let's bring them on, let's bring them into your life and um get ready\\n\\nfor your New Year resolution and write it in a positive way and write it that it calls you forward and\\n\\nthat you're excited to have 2022 be an amazing year for you. Despite anything that shows up out\\n\\nthere, whether it's a, a virus, it's the weather, it's the conditions, financial conditions, there could be a\\n\\nlot of stuff that could happen that are not in your hands. We can't foresee it, can't do much about it\\n\\nuntil it happens. It's almost like a bridge that will just cross when it shows up. Of course, with the\\n\\nbest of my ability as I've survived so far for 60 years, I'm gonna survive the rest. So come with that\\n\\nthought process of what are your strengths, know your strengths, know where you could use them,\\n\\nknow where your vulnerabilities are and take care of them. Don't be ashamed of them. Just take\\n\\ncare of them. We all have them, my boy, it's not like you're the only one who's got to be vulnerable\\n\\nat one point. We all have them. So let's have our strength, take care of our vulnerabilities. Let's trust\\n\\nother people to share our strength with and have their strength to take care of our vulnerabilities of\\n\\ntime and uh move along with our community and our community at large. We fall on on earth and uh\\n\\ncreate the best that we can. So let's get ready for 2022 and I'll see you in 2022.\"),\n",

Um It's the week before we're going to um um have our holiday,\\n\\nChristmas holiday. A lot of people are shopping. Um And more than anything, it just means that we\\n\\nhave people in our minds and in our life that are important to us and we want to let them know that\\n\\nwe care for them. So we go around and look for something that we want them to have or we know\\n\\nthey want to have and uh we show our love to them in that way. I think it is a beautiful season and\\n\\nbeautiful time of our life. It gives us the opportunity to actually do that. Get together, be with each\\n\\nother. Remember the value that each one of us have um in each other's life, uh holding gratitude for\\n\\nwhat we have, what we can create together and uh what we could come up together, having the\\n\\ngratitude of the ability for the people who can bring their family together and and uh go visit their\\n\\nfamily and even the ones that we don't have it with our own family. At least we have it with the\\n\\nchosen families. Um maybe our friends, maybe people who are in our community. It's the time that\\n\\nallows us to share with each other how much we mean to each other. There's also one person uh\\n\\nthat we shouldn't forget in the middle and that's us. You, you shouldn't forget that you are also loved\\n\\nthat you are cared for. And um it's time to listen to your thought process about yourself and see if\\n\\nyou are being loving and caring for yourself. Listen to the way you speak with yourself is love\\n\\npresent, is caring present. Would you say the same things that to someone you really left out there,\\n\\nmaybe to your mate or to your family member or your child or even your pet. Um Do you speak the\\n\\nsame way to yourself? Do you care um to give yourself good food, to take care of your body. Uh\\n\\nOne of the things that has been more apparent to me is how much we might neglect our bodies and\\n\\nhow much that the only vehicle we have in experiencing this beautiful life is our body. So look at\\n\\nyour body, feel it go every part of your body be with it. Say thank you. Grab a uh share with yourself\\n\\nthe gratitude you have for every part of your body, for working, working well and allowing you to\\n\\nexperience the world and even the areas of your body that might not be working well or they're ill.\\n\\nJust hold the gratitude and love and allow them love to begin healing you in a beautiful way. Um\\n\\nLook at your body and just say, look at yourself in the mirror and just say, I love you, I love you body\\n\\nin every part of you for working with me and for me, all these years, sharing your love with yourself\\n\\nand others um is healing. It brings life back into your eyes and brings light into your eyes and uh\\n\\nbrings love not only in your heart, but through your eyes and through your words and shares it with\\n\\nthe people around you, I promise you, you're gonna feel better, you're gonna feel lighter when you\\n\\nexperience the love from inside and not that it's waiting to come from outside. It's beautiful when it's\\n\\nalso reciprocated from outside to you. And I'm positive that somebody around your life and many\\n\\npeople in your life love you, whether they tell you all the time or not, whether they even say it even\\n\\nonce. But if they're around you, they cherish you and um know it that they do. But I think that more\\n\\nthan anything, the love of self um is important because if you don't have that, no matter how many\\n\\npeople love you from out there, you're not gonna believe it. You're not gonna remember that you are\\n\\nlove and that you deserve to be there. So let's have this holiday, a celebration of you loving yourself.\\n\\nLoving your body, loving your heart and expressing all of who you are with people who are around\\n\\nyou and share your love with them. Although you might share it with gifts, but also share it with\\n\\neverything that you need to say that you haven't sat in a loving way. Imagine if this was last holiday\"),\n",

Hello, I'm Doctor Flu J Zane. And this is the tip of\\n\\nthe week. Life brings many experiences. We respond to the dance of life from our internal\\n\\ndisposition. If we usually are positive and happy people, then we handle what shows up with\\n\\nflexibility and see it as a problem to be solved and a gift to grow. However, if our disposition is\\n\\nnegative, we deal with life's happening as intrusions, we will resist it, avoid it. And at times fight with\\n\\nall adversaries that come in front of us. Research across the globe reveals that most people are\\n\\nmildly happy, mildly happy most of the time in his happiness book, Ed Diener. Um ST states that\\n\\nthere are evolutionary reasons for this happiness helps people function by keeping them motivated,\\n\\nmaking them more creative and helpful to others and helping them preserve on average. He also\\n\\nfinds that people are moderately happy but never perfectly happy. Gallup's research shows that\\n\\nsocieties with high happiness scores live in economically developed democratic countries with high\\n\\nvalues in human rights and equal rights for women communities that experience extreme poverty or\\n\\nlive in politically unstable countries score low in life satisfaction. So not all happiness comes from\\n\\ninside external circumstances. Dent are moot. The latest Gallup poll shows anger stress, sadness,\\n\\nphysical pain and worry reached a new global high of 33%. By the end of 2021 we are responsible\\n\\nfor our financial independence and growth. I declare responsibility for our happiness, fulfillment and\\n\\nlife satisfaction. And it's all that happens since it is good for us and can be in our control. We don't\\n\\nhave control over external societal or political matters. However, we do have direct control over our\\n\\nattitudes, choices, beliefs, emotions and actions that can impact our mood. Happy people on\\n\\naverage or better workers tend to be more social, trusting of others, have more friends and\\n\\nphysically and mentally healthier, live longer and have more peaceful and co-operative attitudes. We\\n\\nhad the unique ability to live virtuously and find purpose in our life, creating meaning so we could\\n\\nthrive by envisioning goals based on our values that really that kind of benefits all whether that all is\\n\\nour intimate relationships, marriages, Children, family, work mates or communities. Let's try toward\\n\\nwell being to have a happy disposition of joy, gratitude, love, calm and affection with occasional\\n\\nfeelings of sadness, frustration, worry and guilt. Let's act kindly toward ourselves and one another\\n\\nand let's be committed to originating truly a happy community. Thank you for listening.\"),\n",

I just came back from 12 days um from a resort in Colombia where um I\\n\\nwent through a lot of different types of transformation. And um it was very interesting because it was\\n\\na combination of self-awareness um releasing um you know, walking into a consciousness and\\n\\nawareness of who we are um inside um walking into another kind of realm of spirituality. And um\\n\\nwhat I learned a lot through this past 12 days is that our fears keep coming up. And as long as we\\n\\nhaven't really worked toward uh and toward and through the fears that they're always sitting there\\n\\nwaiting. Um We usually have a way of working with fears as if I'm going to bring my strength and\\n\\ncourage and kind of push the fear away and uh shove it somewhere into a closet where I don't\\n\\nwanna see it or I wanna deny it or I want to avoid it. And this 12 days um brought me into facing\\n\\neach one of them, letting them go purging them. Um And what I learned was more like sitting still\\n\\nwhile they came and went uh was enlightening versus trying to defy them, change them, um, argue\\n\\nwith them or a battle with them or tell them that they shouldn't be there, um, to rationalize even with\\n\\nthem. And, uh, for many years, you know, I've been a therapist for 30 years and I've done all of the\\n\\nstuff. I just told you with all of the, my fears and my client's figures. But it was interesting, the\\n\\nstillness of watching a part of us, which is obviously emotions and has a lot of thoughts and\\n\\nrationality behind it. And it could be that our fears that we experienced because something\\n\\nhappened to us or that it wasn't even ours. It was maybe our parents fears or maybe it was the\\n\\ncommunity fear, maybe the cultural fear that showed up. And uh we took it on, we actually took it on\\n\\nand have reactions to it. We, um you become righteous about the fear and uh that it is what it is and\\n\\nwe have to, uh, I, I have to defy it even with the fear of death which almost every single human\\n\\nbeing have. Um And as I watch the fear show up, give the gift of whatever it was and uh watched it,\\n\\nI felt it and then watched it again and not made it wrong. But it was more like I get it that a part\\n\\nTiffany has this experience. Um It kind of dissolved in a sense in front of me. And uh then it was like,\\n\\nOK, well, if I, if this is not the one that I want to subscribe to, then what is it that I like to subscribe\\n\\nto? But it wasn't this time about denying this and moving to the positive, it was accepting it and\\n\\nmoving to the positive as if it was a beautiful part of me and it was just coming up to talk and the\\n\\nmoment that I watched it come and talk, um then it dissolved. As I said, even the fear of death, there\\n\\nwere many days during that 12 days and I actually thought I'm dying. Uh my heartbeat and my um\\n\\nbreathing had completely changed. And it was interesting that at one point, it was like, OK, well,\\n\\nthen goodbye. You know, I, I hear you, you're right here. And if that's the case, then all right, you\\n\\nknow, I'm dead. Um And that concept of just being with it, it changed a lot, a lot of things at that\\n\\nmoment. Um So being with it passing through, it created the courage versus the other way was\\n\\ncreating the courage to almost like go battle it versus just being with it, allowing it to be and moving\\n\\nforward. It was a profound experience and I just wanted to share that with you. And I also got it that\\n\\nin order to be that still in the mind, um it was through examining all of these fears and allowing them\\n\\nto show up and um that's how the stillness stayed. It was the most beautiful experience. I wish it\\n\\nupon you. I wish upon you to have all the fears show up for you, but I do wish upon you that you\\n\\nexperience stillness. Thank you.\"),\n",

Now, there are times in our relationship when we feel powerful and at\\n\\ntimes powerless. At the beginning stages of our relationship, we may feel powerful in the way we\\n\\nhave someone attracted to us and are willing to do anything for us to be near us and yet powerless\\n\\nwhen we are vulnerable and feel attached and hope that they don't leave us as the relationship\\n\\nmoves to the next phase. We might feel powerful in negotiating and getting our way yet feel\\n\\npowerless when our partner does not budge and we need to give in. We might feel powerful when\\n\\nwe care for our mate, yet feel powerless when we need to depend on them to take care of us. It\\n\\nappears that in any healthy relationship, there is an element of power that is experienced and that\\n\\nexperience is like being on a seesaw, sometimes you're up and other times you're down, the fun of\\n\\nplaying on a seesaw is for each participant to be willing to go up. I'm down and allow the partner to\\n\\nlead at times. The moment that one partner insists on holding to the seesaw by sitting on the ground\\n\\nand not allowing the balance to go up and down again or for the balance to get created right in the\\n\\nmiddle. The game is over with resentment since the other partner is stuck in the air and is at the\\n\\nmercy of their partner to make all the choices. But a seesaw is can be fun. It can be play, it can be\\n\\nallowing each one of us to have the upper hand and lower hand and go up and go down and play\\n\\nand enjoy time as we go through experiences together. The beauty of being in a healthy relationship\\n\\nis for each partner to feel powerful on their own in their own world. Share the power empower each\\n\\nother allow their vulnerabilities to be shared and rely on their partner's power to empower them. For\\n\\nthe for this interaction to go smooth. Partners need to feel safe with each other. Knowing that the\\n\\npower that is experienced is not threatening in any manner, knowing that the power is being\\n\\nasserted for the benefit of us, not one over the other. If you're afraid of losing power in your\\n\\nrelationship, follow these steps, access your inner power, be realistic about your abilities. Be aware\\n\\nof what you can and you cannot control, focus on what is in your domain of influence or control. That\\n\\nis where you're powerful, own your power. You don't need to prove it, just own it and live it allow\\n\\nyour partner to be as powerful as you are. It's much more fun that way. I promise you be realistic\\n\\nabout their abilities, don't expect something that they just don't have grant yourself and in them to be\\n\\nas great and powerful as you are and can be. That goes with no fear, be ok with your grandness\\n\\nand be ok with your partner's grandness. Feel proud of you and them negotiate and give the gift of\\n\\ncompromising and share with love for more observational skills and empowerment skills. Go to my\\n\\nbook Life Reset the awareness integration path to create the life you want. Thank you.\"),\n",

We are on the verge of another shift in our lives. With the summer being\\n\\nhere, vaccinations being offered to everyone and trips being planned. We are getting the sense that\\n\\nlife is coming back to normal. Beyond feeling, excitement for opportunities for having fun and\\n\\nentertainment such as traveling and dining out. There is also the anguish and the stress of having\\n\\nour kids go back to school for us to go back to our office, open businesses, find jobs that are more\\n\\nsuitable for us, socialize with people who we have not seen for more than a year or so on. Change\\n\\nis not easy even when we want it and create it, let alone for matters that we're not ready for resist or\\n\\ndefy. Well, resistance to change creates frustration with anxiety and therefore anger. The singer\\n\\nshows up in any matter of the daily life. I've spoken with mothers who have been homeschooling\\n\\ntheir Children and uh for, for a year or more than a year, although it was very hard for them, they\\n\\nhave adjusted and now got kind of like the hang of it since in fall. They have to go back and driving\\n\\ntheir different Children to different types of schools. Um, they're expressing difficulty arranging,\\n\\nreapplying, modifying all that they have so far they have to change. They also wonder about their\\n\\nkids getting sick again from other kids again while they were immune while they were at home. Uh,\\n\\none mother told me that, um, their kids used to be kind of sick every two weeks at home when they\\n\\nwere at school. And throughout the whole past year, they never got sick. And the minute, the first\\n\\nday they went back to school, they got sick and got the whole family sick again, I'm working with a\\n\\nman who was laid off through the pandemic and this past year has been a stay home of spending\\n\\ntime with a full, as a full time father. He's anxious about searching in the corporate world for similar\\n\\njobs since he was no longer satisfied with his profession. He no longer wants to work in the\\n\\ncorporate world due to feeling stressed with the structures that are, you know, the demand of the\\n\\nstructure of the corporate world has and he's interested in having a professional consulting business\\n\\nthat he can work from home. He's scared, not motivated. He doesn't know how to create structure\\n\\nfor himself does not know how to move forward. The recent poll actually showed that 40% of\\n\\nemployees no longer want to commute and are not going back to their jobs. Their home, looking for\\n\\nremote jobs. These types of life changes brings a lot of instability, anxiety and frustration for people.\\n\\nI spoke with a college graduate who is working in a low salary entry level position. She got laid off\\n\\nand went on in employment. Now she has to go back into a job market with the same entry level\\n\\nposition. She's resisting it. She's looking for a job um since she has been earning more than that\\n\\nwithout any effort. So she has no idea what to do when she goes back, how can we flow with what\\n\\nlife brings for us and how can we envision and pursue what we want in life? Resisting change\\n\\ncreates more anguish and pain. The reality of the outside world will bring about circumstances that\\n\\nwe may have never handled before and therefore may not have the skills for it at times. We only\\n\\nlook at what we don't like within the upcoming change and decide to resist it. We may like the sense\\n\\nof familiarity even if it's not very comfortable. Hence, resist getting out of the status quo, the skill to\\n\\nassess what is changing is important. So let's explore what needs to be changed. Look at your\\n\\nscenario and your life, what can change? Is there anything, is there any part of your life that you can\\n\\ncontinue just the way it is um who would be affected in a positive or negative way if you float with\\n\\nthe change?

What is it about? Facing endings that jolts us into a re evaluation of the\\n\\npast and the future. I've been talking to clients and colleagues about facing endings this week,\\n\\nfacing, ending their career, moving on to retirement, facing getting a divorce and ending their\\n\\ncommitment to their marriage. Facing ending being a stay home mom due to all Children, moving to\\n\\ncollege, facing closing a business that has not been fruitful and so on. It doesn't matter if the ending\\n\\nof a phase of life is due to a natural positive growth or it is due to a disruptive negative\\n\\nconsequence. There's still a common process, some resist the process and go through it with\\n\\nanxiety and agitation while some go through it as an observation, what was and what is to become\\n\\nas I spoke with someone who is facing retirement and shared re evaluating the vision of his future.\\n\\nThe last 10 to 20 active years of his life, completing his responsibilities and going around the world.\\n\\nHe no longer needed to consider anyone else. He saw it as his right to move on and do what he\\n\\nwants to do whether his wife joined him or not. I spoke with a young woman who's getting a divorce.\\n\\nShe shared the vision of herself as a powerful woman who wanted to be great mother and re\\n\\nevaluated her fantasy about marriage and her criteria for decision making. Prior to her first marriage,\\n\\ntalking to a man who wanted to close his business after several years as he re evaluated his myths\\n\\nabout having a business and what he learned that he can use in his life. And the woman who\\n\\nalthough her wish for her Children was to be successful and launch from home is coming through is\\n\\nfacing her identity as another ending while she has no idea who she is and who she will be.\\n\\nSadness, fear, anxiety and excitement are all being fully expressed and experienced. So the\\n\\nrealization that all phases will end and new ones, new beginnings will be there may allow us to move\\n\\nthrough the process with some finesse, allowing the grief process to emerge and to be complete for\\n\\nany stage of life that is ending is a necessary step. A positive vision of what the future may hold will\\n\\nalso call us forward toward actualizing our vision. People who try to skip the grief process, distract or\\n\\nnumb themselves through the process, won't get away from it, just prolong it. Grieving might be\\n\\nacknowledging and going through the sadness, valuing what it was and saying goodbye with grace,\\n\\ncherishing the value and the goodness that was brought into our life, the strength and the skill that\\n\\nwas learned that can be utilized for the future completing and having the willingness to let go. Most\\n\\ntimes, the process of letting go and grieving can be side by side with the process of moving forward\\n\\ntoward the vision of the next phase of life. Asking yourself what is next for me? What is my passion?\\n\\nWhat is it that I have not done and always wanted to do what is left for me to learn? What inspires\\n\\nme, who do I intend to be? So create a realistic vision of yourself, collage about it and put it where\\n\\nyou can constantly see it change is inevitable. Growth is incapable. So let go with grace and move\\n\\nforward with excitement and fines for more observational methods to envision the future. Go to my\\n\\nbook Life resets the awareness integration, path to the life you want. And you can find that in\\n\\nAmazon, I promise you the exercises there will support you to go through all that I just talked about.\"),\n",

This week, I've been working with many people, friends,\\n\\ncolleagues and clients who are facing the pain of watching a family member or friend suffer from an\\n\\nillness, whether it's depression, bipolar cancer, dementia, MS Parkinson's and chronic pain. Being a\\n\\ncaretaker for someone who's suffering from an illness is filled with mixed emotions. It's difficult to\\n\\nfeel that you deserve to rest, take a breather, be happy. We're going to enjoy anything around while\\n\\na loved one is suffering, the emotion of powerlessness creates depression. The attempt to kick out\\n\\nof this powerlessness at times leads to many desperate actions that do not necessarily help\\n\\nanything but it depletes one's energy and financial resources. The process of grief already starts\\n\\nknowing that you will be losing someone experiencing the helplessness and watching the process of\\n\\ndeterioration, deterioration becomes heart wrenching at times when others say nonchalantly get\\n\\nover it and that's just life all will be well, brings rage facing, living with and interacting with a loved\\n\\none who in the time of pain that can be needy, irritating or demanding is really, really tough listening\\n\\nto others who try to be positive and give a general sentence up. It will all be ok. Creates\\n\\ndisconnection. Sometimes it's as if nothing can help trying to keep pseudo positives in front of the\\n\\nloved one that is suffering so that it doesn't affect them is tiring. The responsibility of being a\\n\\ncaretaker is heavy and tiresome. So what can we do to lighten up this process? Let me share with\\n\\nyou ways that you could take care of yourself self camp. One know that all that I mentioned above\\n\\nare normal reactions of a compassionate human being. You experience and you experience and\\n\\nreact. Your experience and reactions may differ and be unique to you. It might be very different to\\n\\nanybody else. So honor them, honor the way you experience and feel. Create away time, physically\\n\\nand emotionally. You need to rest and be away from the pain sometime during the day and the\\n\\nweek. Set up one caring and pampering act for yourself during the day. Massage, nature walk\\n\\nexercise, yoga, meditation, something that not only takes you away but also takes care of you. Be\\n\\npresent with your loved ones, no matter what condition they're in, you don't have to fix this. You\\n\\ncan't fix this but be with them. Your being as it is with them is what gives them the love, the caring\\n\\nand inspires them to do something for themselves. Your love and acceptance will go a long way for\\n\\nyou and that be respectful to your body and to your psyche. When you feel like you've reached your\\n\\nlimit, remove yourself, take care of yourself and then come back, find resources and support. Ask for\\n\\nhelp assess what is in your control and what isn't let go of what's not in your control and act on the\\n\\nones you can't assess what action can actually be beneficial and only spend your energy on those\\n\\ntasks. You deserve to live a happy life, even though a loved one is suffering for more awareness\\n\\nand ways to learn about yourself. Go to my book Life Reset the awareness integration path to create\\n\\nthe love, to create the life you want and um be good to you first when you care for yourself, that's\\n\\nwhen you can actually care for others.\"),\n",

Have you ever noticed when your internal\\n\\nopinions and dialogues are pretty much irrelevant, pointless and are just wasting your valuable time\\n\\nand energy? Imagine sitting in your home or apartment hearing a noise from other apartments or\\n\\nhomes, your mind starts wondering, checking out the noise first, you may check to see if all is safe,\\n\\nthen you may assess to see if you could do anything about the matter so far. So good, definitely\\n\\nrelevant and necessary. Then you may begin assuming and fabricating all the what if scenarios\\n\\nabout the neighbor and what might be happening and then a certain opinion of what you like or\\n\\ndislike or that they should or should not be going or be doing such and such. This is when thoughts\\n\\nand opinions become irrelevant and unnecessary. Although as human beings you're wired to\\n\\nconstantly evaluate and have thoughts and opinions about all stimulus that enters your world. It is\\n\\nimportant to be efficient about the time and energy you spend on thoughts, emotions and behaviors,\\n\\nsomeone who's upset about their coworker way of relating to her Children. Although the coworker's\\n\\nlife has no bearing on this person's life. Um, someone who spends most hours of the day angry at\\n\\ntheir siblings for acting a particular way. Well, they have no authority to make decisions for them\\n\\nanyway. And someone who every day punishes her parents in her own mind about who they were\\n\\nand how they treated her when she was a child while knowing that she has no way of changing. The\\n\\nevents in the past are all the ways that one might spend a better state. It's kind of like waste good\\n\\nenergy and time over irrelevant manner, which would make it pretty much pointless. Unless\\n\\nsomeone enjoys this way of thinking as a dramatic internal entertainment, it may have no other\\n\\nuseful application. So observe, in what ways do you waste your time and energy on irrelevant\\n\\nmatters? What do you consider irrelevant in what areas do you insist? You have to have an opinion\\n\\nwhile no one is really listening or applying your opinion? How much time do you spend ti how much\\n\\ntime do you spend on matters that uproar you emotionally, how many of these matters? You actually\\n\\ndo something that makes a difference for you or others. What would you pay attention to instead if\\n\\nyou choose to let go of the irrelevant thoughts? So I have some suggestions, observe your thoughts,\\n\\nassess if this matter is impacting you directly or indirectly as this. If you have the ability to do\\n\\nsomething about it. Assess if you have the jurisdiction or the authority, the control or the ability to\\n\\ninfluence the matter. Assess if your opinion and actions would benefit you or others. Assess if there\\n\\nare other people who are inviting your opinion or just telling you with their behavior that your opinion\\n\\nis irrelevant to them. Act if you choose to, if the answer to all of what I said was no, then drop it and\\n\\nmove on to a thought and action that is useful, relevant and beneficial for you and others around\\n\\nyou. That is what I call efficiency and thought and emotion and action. So for more observational\\n\\ntools in every area of your life, go to my book, Life Reset the Awareness integration Path to create\\n\\nthe life you want. Thank you for listening.\"),\n",

Um We are filled with dualities when those dualities show up in our\\n\\nconversations, others get confused, lose trust and get angry as human beings. We are constantly\\n\\nexperiencing dualities in ideas or behaviors. We can be conscious of some of these dualities such\\n\\nas knowing what to eat, how to exercise, how to manage time state that we are really committed to\\n\\ndoing it. Yeah, and not take any action. There are times that we say our belief about a matter and\\n\\nnot be conscious that we do the opposite such as stating, hm I'm honest and don't like people to lie\\n\\nbut lie constantly and have justifications for it. When our dualities only affect us, we tend not to have\\n\\nresults that we want. When our dualities affect others, we lose the quality of the relationship. People\\n\\ncan't count on us. They lose respect and trust and they hold back and doubt who we are and our\\n\\nintentions. Teenagers start calling their parents a hypocrite at this time. These types of expressions\\n\\nof dualities create many marital arguments since the married couple makes many decisions together\\n\\nin all areas of life. Clarity and consistency become very important. Sometimes there's no duality. It is\\n\\njust a lack of clear communication. One part of the thought process has been shared while another\\n\\npart has not been expressed, which is still leaves the listener confused when they see an action that\\n\\nis not based on what they heard or expected first. So clarity in communication is important.\\n\\nHowever, the most important factor that would be a prerequisite for that communication is internal\\n\\nclarity. It is the awareness of our different parts needs desires and vulnerabilities that are so\\n\\nimportant. The process of negotiation between the parts facilitates the integration. Therefore,\\n\\ncreating a sense of integrity and wholeness between our thoughts, emotions and actions. When we\\n\\nbecome conscious of our impact on our surroundings and watch for others reactions to our actions\\n\\nand seek feedback from others about us, we become tuned about our dualities and can begin to\\n\\nintegrate our different or opposing beliefs. Our conversations and actions will then be based on a\\n\\nunified inner self, an alignment between our thoughts, our words, our actions brings integrity and\\n\\nconcurrency within ourselves in relationship to ours. We can feel confident others can count on us,\\n\\nbelieve in us and know that when we say something, we're gonna do it. And the whole, the most\\n\\nimportant factor is when you say you're gonna do something, you're gonna feel confident that you're\\n\\ngonna keep your word. And that's when you're gonna feel the most powerful for the awareness\\n\\nintegration skills. Go to my book, Life Reset the awareness integration path to the life you want.

When do you know enough is enough. This does not only relate to\\n\\nthings you don't like, but it could also relate to matters in life that you like, but you need to stop and\\n\\nmove on in a scenario that one is being abused in a relationship and knows leaving is the only\\n\\noption that keeps giving one more chance hoping that it will not happen again, being in a dead end\\n\\njob that has no possibility of growth or holding on to a small business and that is dying down with a\\n\\nfantasy of a miracle. What would it take to act to transformational change in the scenario that one\\n\\ngains pleasure from eating, drinking, using drugs and is paying health consequences for gaming\\n\\nand gambling while going broke? What would it take to stop? It appears that staying in the familiarity\\n\\nof what is even if one is facing a consequence or paying a price becomes much more comfortable\\n\\nthan the anticipated change, even if it appears to be more desirable. Now, does one have to pay a\\n\\nhefty price before getting motivated to change? Well, some do others keep paying small prices and\\n\\nstop right before the disaster happens. Some endure and get used to paying the price and justified\\n\\nand some feel utterly powerless to change anything and feel like a victim of the circumstances. Most\\n\\npeople feel done way before they do something about it. They begin with small steps toward\\n\\nchange, but go back into familiar spaces of what they knew this, lift some pressure and appears that\\n\\nthey are delaying, paying the price. So they will be at the edge of enough. Again, these bargaining\\n\\nstages might go for a very long time while the consequences are getting harder, some pay the hefty\\n\\nprice of getting injured, becoming ill, going bankrupt or other consequences and then change. Some\\n\\njust hang in there until the environment changes such as the abuser finally leaves the business\\n\\ncompletely crashes, they get fired or lose their loved ones. So enough is enough.

There's a way you can talk to promote effective communication or destroy\\n\\nthe message, the relationship and the person's character. If the communication is not intentional and\\n\\nit is only reactive, the possibility of destruction is much higher. I've been talking to many people this\\n\\nweek who unintentionally and reactively have destroyed their relationship to a point of no return, a\\n\\nfather who has a certain standard. And when his teenage son does not listen to him and does not\\n\\nand does whatever his peers want him to do, he blasts in anger and attacks every part of his son's\\n\\ncharacter resulting in destroying his son's self esteem or a um a woman who's so angry with her\\n\\nhusband for not giving her what she needs at home after telling him for 10 years that um she starts\\n\\nscreaming so hard that the husband ends up leaving the house and blames her for what does not\\n\\nwork in their marriage. So when you only concentrate on what you have to say and what you need\\n\\nto gain, the mode of communication becomes like a monologue, a one way directed conversation\\n\\nonly to get your desired outcome without any consideration toward the other person's feelings or\\n\\nneeds. This way of communicating may be fine for one time interactions when you're not uh when\\n\\nyou're only needing to obtain a service. However, for long lasting relationships, there needs to be a\\n\\ndialogue with both people's needs, desires and emotions being considered. Emotional reactivity\\n\\ndoes not promote communication. The message gets lost in heat of the moment. It is important for\\n\\nyou to become aware of your style of communication. So let's observe together how do you enter a\\n\\ndialogue? You do it in a positive and a negative in a kind way, in a derogatory way, in a provocative\\n\\nway. Do you begin with curiosity about the person you're communicating with? Or you don't\\n\\npractically care or you have assumptions about the person or the group you're talking to and you go\\n\\nbased on that assumption or whatever else that crow shows up for you. Are you curious and in\\n\\nwonder of what their needs, emotions and thoughts are or you plan to tell them what their thoughts\\n\\nand emotions and needs should be? Do you consider whether they're ready to hear you receive you\\n\\nand co-operate with you? Do you assume negative thoughts, intentions and emotions from them to\\n\\nyou? Are you aware of your full intention when sharing your thoughts and emotions with them? Are\\n\\nthere any hidden intentions there? Like I wanna be loved or I wanna get my my point across and I\\n\\njust wanna get what I need. What is all of the intentions that are there? Does your style of\\n\\ncommunication consider how you impact them by saying it in a particular way? Do you know what\\n\\nstyle of communication works best for the person you're talking to? Do? You know them enough to\\n\\ndo you consider based on their reactions, their body reactions and what it might be. Do you state\\n\\nwhat you want in demanding way or do you request your want and ask them if they could offer it to\\n\\nyou? Do you get frustrated or angry if they say no or do you respect the answer and negotiate so\\n\\nthat you both are satisfied for more observational and communication skills.

I've experienced um love and loss as the two sides of the same coin that moves along on\\n\\na parallel process. Love in relationships comes along with a sense of attachment which in turn has\\n\\nto face the possibility of loss at every moment in a healthy relationship. One moves from one phase\\n\\nof the relationship to another. Each transition takes letting go of the last phase of the relationship,\\n\\nwhich feels like a loss, letting go of singlehood toward gaining couple, the loss of honeymoon stage\\n\\nof as one moves toward the next stage, could be even power struggle stage or at the loss of lover\\n\\nera to a parenthood era, letting go of being needed as a parent when Children grow up are all the\\n\\ndifferent ways that one goes through the natural transition of life and experience love and loss.\\n\\nWhen we lose someone that we love, whether it's due to divorce, death, migration or phase of life\\n\\nissues. We go through a deep grief. Each one of us goes through this type of a process of grief in\\n\\nour own unique way, depending on the style of our own attachment. Some get caught in denying\\n\\nand refusing to experience loss by acting as if nothing happened, for example, holding on to clothes\\n\\nor the room as it exactly was when the person left, whether they died or, you know, the Children\\n\\nwent to school, um Just keep it exactly the way it was. As if at any moment, we walk into that room\\n\\nand they're still there some fight the loss and get angry at the person for leaving or dying or the\\n\\ndoctors for letting this happen or for uh somebody, somebody's friend or mother or somebody who\\n\\ntook our lover away. Some bargain with many what ifs and hope to find the right scenario for the\\n\\nloss to go away and wake up from this bad dream to find the person again. Some go into despair\\n\\nand hopelessness, a loss of their own identity. Some question the notion and the meaning of love\\n\\nand life while they face loss I've noticed. But as one reaches the sadness of compassion for the self\\n\\nhealing happens, the love that was geared toward being fulfilled from the outside, comes from the\\n\\ninside, toward the self completion with the relationship. And the person also helps looking at what\\n\\nwe learned from. The relationship, helps us with the completion and therefore letting go acceptance\\n\\nof loss as a natural part of life, as a natural growth of human beings. And as a natural phase of\\n\\nrelationships will allow us to pass through these processes with grace, allowing ourselves to accept\\n\\nloss as a natural ongoing phase will help us not get stuck in the denial or try to fight it. So as we\\n\\nanticipate loss, we can also engage fully in relationships and life when it's when it's present fully in\\n\\nfront of us. Some people due to their original negative experiences of anxious attachment with their\\n\\npeople, mother and father and their caregiver experiencing extreme loss as a trauma when they\\n\\nwere a child or the pain of losing a loved one. And they generalize this experience and live with\\n\\nconstant fear and pain of loss as if they've just closed their heart and they're not going to go into any\\n\\nrelationship or when they do always standing there waiting for the other shoe to drop because\\n\\nthey're gonna face loss. So they actually they face loss every minute. So re parenting the self\\n\\nhealing, our childhood traumas will help us unite with different parts and become whole. We can\\n\\nthen cherish the feeling of love and experience in fully when it's present and grieve it appropriately\\n\\nwhen it's lost versus living in the loss every day. An expectation of the experience of love as a\\n\\nconstant matter is kind of an illusion loss will be there no matter what the generating love\"),\n",

There is an interesting notion about love. Have you\\n\\nnoticed we can love God, poetry, babies, pets, and perhaps even our shoes. I love my shoes with\\n\\nthe highest level of affection. With a new expectation. It can be personal and we can be attached,\\n\\nbut there's no expectation of a return. It is a generous experience of warmth and connection that is\\n\\nassigned to someone or something or some category out there. As we assign the object of our\\n\\naffection out there, we create and generate pleasure for ourselves. We do this also at the beginning\\n\\nof our relationships with people and our mates, we assign good virtues and fantasy of greatness to\\n\\nthem and we enjoy our own experience within our sweet fantasy of experiencing love. So what\\n\\nhappens in relationships when there are expectations of reciprocal actions from another person?\\n\\nWell, resentment. Definitely, I've seen very religious people who had assigned only love to God to\\n\\nturn when it became personal after they got sick or lost someone near to them. The expectation was\\n\\nfor God to return the favor and when the protection was not offered then got hurt and abandoned\\n\\ntheir belief. I also have been a witness to parents who raised their Children with the hopes of the\\n\\nreciprocal affection. When their child does not do what they want them to do, they punish them\\n\\nharshly and they take away their love and kindness in intimate relationships and marriages. The\\n\\nhoneymoon phase can turn into a power struggle phase and divorce if love is not reciprocated in a\\n\\nparticular way. So is it the expectation that kills love? But don't we have to operate and some\\n\\nexpectation within our relationships? Well, for sure, every relationship operates based on some\\n\\nreciprocal transaction. The problem becomes when the relationship rules have not been talked\\n\\nabout addressed nor negotiated. Most people operate from a bunch of preset rules and expectations\\n\\nthat they assume the other party already knows and expected. Then there is a rude awakening,\\n\\nwhoops, the other person already had their own preset rules that they were holding us responsible\\n\\nfor and are scolding us for not doing it their way. But wait, wait, wait, it was supposed to be my rules.\\n\\nI should be scolding them their audacity, right? Even when it comes to God, we form our beliefs and\\n\\nexpectations based on our religious teachings. When God becomes personal, then we expect\\n\\npersonal rewards or punishments. And if we were good and held our end of the bargain, well, then\\n\\nwe expect personal care. Even from God. Does this mean that love can only uphold if our\\n\\nexpectations are fulfilled. Well, no love can be upheld, upheld, no matter what. If we stop attaching\\n\\npersonal expectations to it, we can love with no attachment to the result. We can experience joy,\\n\\nrespect, acceptance, kindness, good wishes for the others. Regardless of their reciprocation, we can\\n\\neven choose not to be with someone in a particular relationship because we can't agree on the\\n\\nparameters of the relationship or what is expected of each other and continue to love them. We can\\n\\nget a divorce and choose to love our ex. We can choose to love our siblings but not hang out. We\\n\\ncan love our friends and not want to do business with them. Love is yours to experience freely with\\n\\nno attachment. You can choose to form attachments, form expectations, communicate your needs\\n\\nand desire, form structures and get agreements as extra elements that are needed for a healthy\\n\\nrelationship. So love because it's joyous because it feels good because it's your essence. Thank\\n\\nyou.\"),\n",

Why would we need to regenerate love if we already love someone? Wouldn't it just be\\n\\nenough and it will continue the way it is. So first let's define love. Webster says it's an intense feeling\\n\\nof deep affection. Wikipedia says love encompasses a range of strong and positive, emotional and\\n\\nmental state from the most sublime virtue or good habit, the deepest interpersonal affection to the\\n\\nsimplest pleasure. I would the unconditional acceptance of the person as they are and wanting the\\n\\nbest for that person. Most people get into a relationship with high hopes and high level of faith and\\n\\nvision to be in love, to offer their best and see the best in the other person. As time passes, they get\\n\\nto know each other and begin to like or dislike parts of other person's character or behaviors. They\\n\\nmay start focusing on someone's negative character in order to change it. Communication is healthy\\n\\nand they hold the highest respect for their own and their uh mates needs and desires. They will\\n\\ncommit to actions and behaviors and will create happiness and fulfillment uh within their relationship.\\n\\nThe relationship can move into an unhealthy stage where people only think of themselves and want\\n\\nto fulfill their own need versus looking at the bigger picture of the US and work and what works for\\n\\nthe US. No, just me. When this way of being continues, then love giving acceptance, compassion\\n\\nand empathy begins to subside. People retrieve to their own corners and survive their relationship\\n\\nversus relating and loving with joy. Love becomes a habitual ritualistic or an obligatory concept\\n\\nversus a generative one. I keep hearing, I love him but just don't like him anymore or I love her.\\n\\nShe's the mother of my Children. I just don't want to live that way. It's also the taking it all for granted\\n\\nstage, which could happen to any relationship when someone loses their appreciation and gratitude\\n\\nfor every act of kindness that is offered when acts of kindness become routine. A sense of\\n\\nentitlement begins and emerge. And unfortunately, they forget that it's all a voluntary gift and it can\\n\\nbe taken away any minute if the focus is lifted from appreciating the goodness of what is for\\n\\ncounting all that is lacking. Love suffers and gives way to resentment and anger. So what is\\n\\ngenerating and regenerating love? It is when you fostered intense affection within you and give it as\\n\\na gift to your mate, your friends to the family, people only know how to reciprocate love when it is\\n\\noffered to them and don't know how to generate love inside without the trigger of someone loving\\n\\nthem first. When it comes to your mate, since you would have to share most areas of your life and\\n\\nmake major decisions with each other. This gift of acceptance and giving becomes of the utmost\\n\\nimportance allowing yourself to share all of you and your mate and offer an allowance for your mate\\n\\nto be who they are with. You come from all is great with who your mate is. Even when you don't\\n\\nmake a behavior, negotiating the corrective function on behaviors can be done much graciously\\n\\nwhen there is no threat to your mate's identity and character, who they are bad and wrong that they\\n\\nwill defend who they are and their behavior. So generating love means filling yourself with love and\\n\\nacceptance and joy and then offering it to others. Every human being's nature is capable of\\n\\nexperiencing love and sharing it. If someone holds you back from experiencing love, then you need\\n\\nto clear it so that you can experience the highest pleasure of life for creating awareness in your life\\n\\nabout how you foster generate, give or receive love. Go to my book Life Reset the Awareness\\n\\nintegration path to create the life you want. Thank you.\"),\n",

And this is tip of the week. Are you fulfilled in life? I had my first\\n\\nexperience with Clubhouse the uh social media app last week and we talked about how to be\\n\\ncommitted to the experience of fulfillment in life, regenerated constantly. So we had a great dialogue\\n\\nand I wanted to share it with you first, let's define fulfillment. The d the dictionary definition of\\n\\nfulfillment is the act of process of fulfilling a promise or all requirements of the task. And the second\\n\\ndefinition is act or process of delivering a product to a customer. OK. So how would that relate to life\\n\\nin general? So we expanded it, the act or process of experiencing the state of happiness, intent and\\n\\nbeing complete with matters and situations that show up in life. It is a transient and dynamic state.\\n\\nSo it's not like you get to be fulfilled and then it stays no matter what. So don't take it for granted. It's\\n\\nkind of one of those things, they gotta keep regenerating the short term goals and fulfilling them.\\n\\nAnother component of being fulfilled is living a regret for give you every situation that we end up not\\n\\nliking. We're thinking that it is a mistake as an experience to learn from. I saw this quote on linkedin,\\n\\nGod will put you in positions you didn't apply for. I really liked it. I'm not a religious person but that\\n\\nlike this cup. So view it as if with the information that was available at that time, we did the best rout\\n\\nthat we knew how and as time passes, we learn more about it and into our experience. So no\\n\\nregrets, only learning from an experience and moving on having the wisdom to assess that. There\\n\\nare times we need to do something on other drugs. Our non action is the most important action,\\n\\nliving a balanced life, a balance between responsibilities, self care, caring for others, workplay and\\n\\ngiving to the bigger community would lead to fulfillment in life, being on integrity, doing what you said\\n\\nyou would do, keeping your promises, deliver what you said and clean up when you don't trusting\\n\\nyourself and others and being true to yourself and others. It's fulfilling. How do we keep experiencing\\n\\nfulfillment while the world around us is full of suffering? Great bull, no compassion and empathy and\\n\\ncome in and really support you. You can have compassion and empathy toward people around you,\\n\\nconnect with people's souls and acknowledge their needs. Take a moment to see how far you've\\n\\ncome opportunities you have the ones you've created for yourself, the ones you've created for\\n\\nothers opportunities that have been offered to you. Your gratitude, grateful for who you are and who\\n\\nyou have around you offer opportunities to others in any way that you're able to learn the helping\\n\\nhand or an ear or a shoulder. Someone in need, adjust your expectations from people around you.\\n\\nAssess what you're in control of and what you're not act appropriately on areas that you could do\\n\\nsomething about and be effective and accept and flow with what you cannot control. Raise the level\\n\\nof curiosity and regenerate excitement, engagement and joy for yourself and everyone around you\\n\\nwhen you go beyond yourself and you are out there to be out there for others. That's what actual\\n\\nessence of fulfillment shows up and gets regenerated all the time. For more observational and\\n\\nintegration of skills.

It is interesting how many stories we allow\\n\\nourselves to make when we need to act on a particular behavior. At times, the behavior itself is\\n\\nsufficient enough and the added stories become the hindrance. This week, I've been aware of this\\n\\nmatter repeatedly with myself. Colleagues and clients. This happens a lot in the work environment,\\n\\nin marriages or in parent, child relationships usually happens when someone has to do a task which\\n\\nthey really don't want to at work, write a report, um finish studying, write a paper, do homework, do\\n\\nchores at home. Many, many other areas of life that you really don't want to do something or you\\n\\nwant others to do it and they're not doing it. The examples are when a person needs to do a task at\\n\\nwork, which might take them half an hour. However, they spent hours and days thinking about why\\n\\nthey shouldn't do the task, why their work requires it. Why their life is in such a shambles that they\\n\\nhave to do this job? Why are they a failure that they have to do this? How bad the company is, how\\n\\nawful their boss is. How bad everybody else is, how mean and incompetent everybody else is in\\n\\ntheir life that they actually have to do this task. The point is you still have to do the task in order not\\n\\nto face other unwanted consequences. But you spend many hours or days of pre task time and\\n\\nmany more hours and days post task, creating stories about being victimized and how the world is\\n\\nunfair and that you just don't want to do this if it was an ideal world. Now, remember remember the\\n\\ntask only takes half an hour. The rest of the time is making up and rehashing negative narrative\\n\\nabout it. Another example came about when a mate or a parent needed the garbage to be taken\\n\\nout. I'm sure all of you have felt that way. The task of taking a garbage out two minutes max five\\n\\nminutes. However, this person kept looking at the garbage and got upset all day. Drew their anger\\n\\nwatched and waited for the other person to fail in not taking the garbage out when they wanted it.\\n\\nFinally, they did it themselves since it was smelly then felt victimized for hours about why they have\\n\\nto do this and blasted their partner and their child for never doing anything around the house. This\\n\\nprocess happened every day, taking the garbage out, took five minutes. But the before and after\\n\\nnarrative and the blast ruined her own day in her relationship. It is important to listen to your\\n\\ncomplaint and see if there are communications agreements or boundaries that are needed to solve\\n\\na problem. However, continuing to complain repeatedly about a task that only takes minutes to\\n\\ncomplete becomes a waste of your time and emotionally toxic for yourself and people around you, it\\n\\nis important for you to choose to either do the task or not. Each choice obviously has some benefit\\n\\nand consequences. Notice if you need to communicate or negotiate for the cooper operation of\\n\\nanother person in doing the task with you or for you. If you ask repeatedly and did not get the result,\\n\\nthen you may need to renegotiate until you come to an agreed upon action and time, which works\\n\\nfor both of you and it will finally be done. My suggestion is to complete the task that needs to be\\n\\ndone so that you do not have to face the consequences of not doing the task. Listen to your own\\n\\ncomplaint. If it is about you and your life, see what you need to change or resolve so that you no\\n\\nlonger have the complaint. If you need other people's cooper operation, then join them and listen to\\n\\nsee how two of you can come up with a solution to this matter so that it is resolved, release yourself\\n\\nfrom unnecessary negative narratives that suck your energy and create anguish and anger for you\\n\\nand everyone else around you to resolve your communication agreement and negotiations with\\n\\npeople. You hold responsible and accountable so that it is a set up for success and things get done\"),\n",

This week. I've been observing the\\n\\nconcept of letting go. Why is it so hard to let go of some people or things and not the others? What\\n\\nmakes us hold such an attachment to one person and not another? How come we hold on to some\\n\\nmemory and let go of many more. I look back in my life and see certain happy memories are there\\n\\nas a video side by side with some sad memories. But what happened to all the other ones, all the\\n\\nother memories that were part of my life? I also noticed that with my clients, there are certain\\n\\nemotionally charged memories from the past that are always there to be returned to while others just\\n\\ndon't seem important. It appears that when an event is charged with intense levels of emotions,\\n\\nwhether positive or negative and it hangs around and other events just kind of like get pruned away\\n\\nduring our sleep time or just fade away as non important as time passes. I also have noticed that\\n\\ndepending on the meaning that we have given to the event, the decisions we made about ourselves\\n\\nand our surrounding and others, we give significance to that particular event. So the event itself is\\n\\nonly a trigger for the origination of our perception, creating certain opinions about it, right? The\\n\\nmeaning we give it is the origin of the significance for our attachments. When we become aware of\\n\\nthat significance, given to the decision about the self ourselves and our surroundings, then we can\\n\\nexplore and challenge the decision to see if it applies to the reality of who we are today. Challenging\\n\\nthe significance to see if in the bigger scheme of life, including our strength, skills and resiliency we\\n\\npossess still holds relevance. So for example, if you're still holding on to a memory in your childhood\\n\\nabout your mom or your dad behaving in a particular way with you, observe what the child in your\\n\\nmemory of that event, thought and felt about him or herself and others. What decisions did the child\\n\\nmake about him or herself and others? Is it true? Now the same decision? Is it applicable now? And\\n\\nbased on your skills, strength and your daily outcomes, do you see that decision is still relevant? If\\n\\nyou determine that the decision is no longer necessary and does not hold value for your present life,\\n\\nyou may let go of the significance you assign to it, you may upgrade the decision to one that makes\\n\\na difference today for you and furthers your life toward fulfillment to investigate more and how you\\n\\ncan give you have given a significance of the past issues and ways of letting it go. Um Go to my\\n\\nbook, Life Reset the Awareness integration path to create the life you want.\"),\n",

Yes, the ability to connect to everyone in the\\n\\nworld through technology and being in the vicinity of someone's presence all at the same time, I'm\\n\\nenjoying running groups and being with clients on video as much as I truly enjoy having clients in my\\n\\noffice.

This week, I've been looking at fitting too\\n\\nmany activities into our day. I've been juggling different activities into my already hectic week. New\\n\\nactivities and requests showed up and I had to make a decision about how to change and fit it all\\n\\nwho needed to be done into a flowing and yet full calendar. I also have spoken with people who\\n\\nhave been juggling work, purchasing a home, dealing with family emergencies, anything you can\\n\\nimagine into their life. So the short answer to the clear structure with lots of flexibility and lots of\\n\\nrequests from others to give your their gift of flexibility to you. The path to that short answer is the\\n\\nfollowing one. Pick important tasks and appointments that are unchangeable and set them up in the\\n\\ncalendar. Like you know, your work schedule, sleep schedule, school schedule, two, choose the\\n\\nappointments with people who cannot be changed and set them up in your calendar. Three, choose\\n\\nthe tasks and appointments that can be changed and locate the possibility of moving them to\\n\\nanother time slot. Four, contact the people with whom you have an appointment and request the\\n\\ntime change. Give them some options that work for you and see if they can match one of them, if\\n\\nnot ask them to give you some options which you can choose from. Do this one person at a time so\\n\\nthat you only have to negotiate once and that you don't offer the same time slot to too many people.\\n\\nFive choose tasks that can be done in flexible time and set them up in open time spots. Six, be\\n\\nhonest with others about why you need to change the priority of the and the need for change. And\\n\\nmost importantly, your gratitude for their flexibility and allowance for this time change. Seven, take a\\n\\ndeep breath, relax your body and become present fully. Although this process can be stressful. The\\n\\nability to do this with ease and finesse is the key being fully present at every task and every\\n\\nappointment is very important at times, people do the act of changing their cal you know, calendar\\n\\nso that they can attend to everything. However, their stress accompanies them throughout and does\\n\\nnot allow them to to be present or enjoy the task or the whole day. So your stress will show up in\\n\\nyour body, tone of voice, facial expressions and facial muscles, choice of words and often your\\n\\nresults.

So I've been talking to clients and colleagues\\n\\nabout forgiving someone for something that they have done in the past and have corrected their\\n\\nbehavior since then. Versus holding the resentment, the pain continuously, which ends up punishing\\n\\nthem as well as us. I talked to a mother whose teen used to defy her and lie to her around age 12 as\\n\\nthey both came to therapy and shifted their communication. The teen actually began respecting the\\n\\nboundaries that her mother had set for her and shared with her mother her thoughts and needs.\\n\\nHowever, even after three years, the mom kept treating her daughter as if the corrective behavior\\n\\never happened. I spoke with a woman whose husband had cheated on her 22 years ago and she\\n\\nhad a meltdown. But then of course they decided to stay together and he kept his promise of never\\n\\nbetraying her again for the past 20 years. However, every day she has a meltdown about the affair\\n\\nand tells him how hurt she is because of what he did to her. I also spoke with a woman whose\\n\\nmother meddled in their marriage. And since they came from a kind of a tribal culture, she had no\\n\\nidea, nor the skills to take a stand and set a boundary for her family of origin. However, after three\\n\\nyears into the marriage, she got it and, um, she needed to tell her mother and she did talk to her\\n\\nmother. And for the past 15 years, she has not allowed her family of origin to interfere in their\\n\\nmarriage in the marital affair and marital life every week when she wants to make a decision with her\\n\\nhusband about her manner in her life, he accuses her of checking in with her mother. So what's the\\n\\nimpact of holding on to an upset for a lifetime? Even though the unhealthy behavior that we ask for\\n\\nhas actually changed? The answer is constant misery then, right? We got what we want, but we\\n\\nwon't let it go. So, in relationships, there are many occasions that we hurt each other. My mistake,\\n\\nuh, misunderstandings, intentional or unintentional. It's important to clarify, share, take responsibility\\n\\nfor what we have done. Clean up state, what needs to be changed, be committed to the change.\\n\\nAnd if we don't get a chance to share and be heard, if the person who hurt us does not take\\n\\nresponsibility for their action and how they have hurt us, if there's no request for a change of\\n\\nbehavior and there's no commitment to change. Of course, and we get stuck in the hurt pain and our\\n\\ngrief. But it is important to recognize when a promise has been kept, has been kept and times and\\n\\nhave and times have reassured us that the healthy behavior we requested is here to stay. It is also\\n\\nimportant for us to take the responsibility of healing ourselves, forgiving, moving on and enjoying the\\n\\nrelationship. When someone hears us and change their behavior to what we request. It is important\\n\\nto validate their effort and share our gratitude toward them. This positive attention motivates people\\n\\nto act in a healthy manner beside us. So when someone hears you and changes their behavior for\\n\\nyou, forgive them and begin enjoying the relationship daily. For more observational skills and\\n\\nmending the past. Go to my book Life Reset the Awareness Integration Path to create the love you\\n\\nwant. You can get that on fujian.com or Amazon. We'll be right back.\"),\n",

Most people call it procrastination. I've been conversing with clients and colleagues about the\\n\\ncalls the process and how to overcome procrastinating. I've noticed that no one talks about\\n\\nprocrastinating for what they love to do and they're passionate about. Mostly you hear people\\n\\nprocrastinate about tasks that they think they should be doing should have been done for some\\n\\nfuture reward, not for the j joy of the task itself. Some scientists state that it is a lack of self\\n\\nregulation. Some suggest that it is the inability to manage time and emotion. Others say that it is\\n\\nwhen a person recognizes the future consequences of what they're doing, but they can't overcome\\n\\nthe emotional urge toward a diversion. Another study showed that self control only succumbs to\\n\\ntemptation when present emotions can be improved as a result. Some psychologists believe that the\\n\\nprocess is caused by the inconsistency of the parenting style of teaching, delayed gratification.\\n\\nOthers might see the cause as authoritarian style of parenting which has produced an aversion for a\\n\\nperson who might have seen their parents forcing them to do tasks versus listening to what they, uh,\\n\\nwhat they enjoy. The process usually appears as a nudge from a part of us that reminds us that we\\n\\nhave to do a task such as a, write a paper, pay a bill, wash the dishes, call a person study\\n\\nsomething that we just, uh, we don't like what we've got to do. Another part, ignores the reminder\\n\\nand diverts it into a task that is more enjoyable. Some debate in their mind about why they need to\\n\\ndo another task first. Um, they need to do another task that was first on the list before they will take\\n\\nthe, uh, directives from this part that tells them what to do. Some outright rebel against the part of\\n\\nthemselves as if the demand is coming from the authoritative pair. Almost all. Wait until the last\\n\\nsecond before the ultimate consequence shows up before rushing the town. I feel anxious, sad,\\n\\nangry, irritated, shameful, guilty, disgusted, hopeless and powerless, not lot of feelings. So no\\n\\nmatter what the cause or the process, it is important for anyone to master the game of setting the\\n\\nintention followed by an action in a timely manner to create a successful and fulfilled life. I suggest\\n\\nthe following steps. 11 steps. All right. So listen up one, make your calendar, your best friend to\\n\\nshare all that needs to be done with your best friend. The calendar, three fill up all of its time with\\n\\nactions that you do, whether you think it is mundane or not. Four, fill in time for sleep hygiene, work,\\n\\nschool socialization, hobby task, everything that you do put it in fine. Observe your inner dialogue.\\n\\nFor the reason that we already talked about for postponing a task. Six. Accept the part of you that is\\n\\nresisting, don't fight it, don't ding it, don't put it down, just accept it. That's a part of you. Seven. Find\\n\\na reward system or action that would motivate you. Eight, associate some reward while doing a task\\n\\nsuch as eat your favorite snack while you're doing the task. Nine, create task time with intermittent\\n\\nintermittent rewards in between, right? Such as do the work for 20 minutes, play a game for 10\\n\\nminutes or each for 10 minutes, go back to the original task and this way you'll just go back and forth\\n\\nand back and forth. 10, set up a price reward system at the end such as promise yourself to get a\\n\\nmassage, take a bath, go to dinner with a friend, something that is, it feels good to you. But you first\\n\\ngot to do this before you do that right? And 11 record the sense of accomplishment and positive\\n\\nfeelings you journaling or sharing your verbally with a friend or a mate and you know, kind of like\\n\\nvalidate yourself with a job well done. Remember the joy is in the confidence of in the ability to learn\"),\n",

I have just come from a retreat of many\\n\\ndays of meditation and I just felt like I was calm. And as I woke up every morning, I did my\\n\\nmeditation and I went through the calmness of the day as if I could handle anything and anything in\\n\\nthe world would show up. And it was just kind of like, like a, like a teflon on the back. It wouldn't even\\n\\nstick. And amazingly enough, I didn't do, I didn't have time to do meditation for a couple of days. And\\n\\nthis morning, I woke up as if that agitation is there and the agitation does not necessarily represent\\n\\nanything. It's just a wrap agitation that is there. And then I watched my head, my brain, my thought\\n\\nprocess um as they looked for things that were there to pick on as if I needed something for the\\n\\nagitation to kind of uh get stuck to go forward and attach itself to where the same issues and the\\n\\nsame conversations and the same matters were there the week before. So I wonder what is the\\n\\ndifference between the times that I'm calm and open and um kind of flexible with things that are\\n\\nhappening and look at those from the perspective of all is well, or that there's an agitation that is\\n\\nlooking for a problem to solve, looking for things that are out there to make a point at it. So I realized\\n\\nalso that a lot of people I work with, um they look at things with, for example, they wake up one day\\n\\nin their relationship and they look at all the things that have been there the day before the way\\n\\nbefore that for years. But today they're gonna pick at it, they're gonna say how much they don't like\\n\\nit, which is another day, same things are there, but they're flexible with it. What's the difference? The\\n\\nsame thing can happen at work. You may be at the same type of job for many, many years. One\\n\\nday it's intolerable another day. It's as if all is well, I can handle it. So it is important to know that the\\n\\nway we are with our world either makes it or breaks the way we attend to the world as is it creates a\\n\\nspace, whether we could go with an openness to clear things, to handle things or we can go with an\\n\\nagitation with an attitude with a chip on our shoulder with a sense of entitlement of why it would be\\n\\nthis way and resisting it and then changing it from a resistance place versus changing and adapting\\n\\nand from a place that is like, it's all, it's all well and I'm gonna, you know, core or shift or adapt to\\n\\nwhat's happening or even change what's happening. So they come from, it's almost like the energy\\n\\nyou come from dealing with things. It could either be a soft flow or it could be um a fight you get to\\n\\nchoose. I was privy to look at, I wake up sometimes with a fighting mode and then I have to take\\n\\ncare of myself to calm down that area, that agitation that showed up and there's nothing wrong with\\n\\nit. And you don't always have to look at where is it showing up from? It's great to listen to it and see\\n\\nwhere is it coming from. And maybe if there's something you really need to handle, take care of\\n\\nyourself in some way so that the agitation is released and handled. On the other hand, is also\\n\\nimportant to see if that agitation belongs to a certain matter just because it's here. It might also cling\\n\\nto all matters in life and create more of a problem than it is just because the agitation clung to\\n\\nsomething. So be aware of that. And the more that you can let go of that agitation and allow it to be\\n\\nhandled or whatever the actual issue is, then it doesn't have to kind of spread over everything in all\\n\\nareas of your life, uh, during the day. Thank you.\"),\n",

This week, I've been working with\\n\\nfacing duality inside of us, which ends up paralyzing us toward any action. This has been very\\n\\nprevalent in the decision making of whether someone wants to stay in their relationship or move on\\n\\nwhether one should stay at a job or leave it to another position or if one should end a business\\n\\npartnership or not. So how do we make the best decision for us when each part of us wants and\\n\\nneeds different outcomes? And what is the best decision? How do we come to an alignment and\\n\\nagreement between our separate parts? One of the biggest inner conflict is when the situation we're\\n\\nin is not ideal. If we stay in the relationship, we're not completely fulfilled. And if it does, it just\\n\\ndoesn't feel good enough or it feels not enough. If we let go of the current relationship for the hope\\n\\nof the ideal future relationship, we might lose what we have right now. So at times, we just cling to\\n\\nwhat we have with a sense of resignation, victimization while we yearn for the ideal relationship to\\n\\njust fall into our lap with a guarantee of giving us all that we want. Well, some people wait passively\\n\\nwhile they look eagerly out there, some become depressed since they lose hope for having the\\n\\ncurrent relationship work and lose hope for ever getting what they want. And some continue with the\\n\\nagony of vacillation between staying and leaving daily. So at times, inter relationship, whether in a\\n\\nit's a romantic relationship, intimate relationship or business or work relationship with the most\\n\\nimmediate need, such as I'm lonely. So I want to be in a relationship or I need money, I need a job\\n\\nright now. Um Or um this opportunity is just too good to pass up. Um And after fulfilling the existing\\n\\nneed, other needs that are necessary to be fulfilled now show up such as I also um want someone\\n\\nwho is emotionally mature or I need my autonomy or um other things that show up for us afterward.\\n\\nPeople try to fulfill their other needs within the same structure of the same relationship. However, the\\n\\nrelationship might have never been set up to fulfill all other needs. Hence, the duality of fulfilling all\\n\\nneeds simultaneously begins. So what do we do? Let's take the following steps. One, observe your\\n\\ndifferent needs, observe them and then to write them down. What is your request? What is it that\\n\\neach part of you wants? Three? Can you fulfill parts of your needs in this relationship? And what are\\n\\nthey for? Have you communicated to your partners about your needs or is it just that it's inside of\\n\\nyou and you haven't shared anything? Fine. Is your partner capable of offering you a solution to\\n\\nfulfill the need within the structure of your current relationship or not? Six, is your need a current and\\n\\nappropriate adult need or is it a chi childhood unfulfilled need or is an unrealistic need? Seven, write\\n\\nthe pros and cons of staying in the relationship. Eight, write the pros and cons of leaving the\\n\\nrelationship. Now put two chairs in front of each other and assign staying to one chair and leaving to\\n\\nanother 10, sit on the staying chair position and um talk about the rationale and all of your emotions\\n\\nfor you and the need to stay 11, sit on the leaving position, chair at the other side and talk about the\\n\\nrationale and all of your emotions and needs of why you need to leave and then keep going back\\n\\nand forth until you come to some defined negotiation between the two parts. 13 then stand tall on\\n\\ntop of both chairs and be a mediator between your two parts. 14, take your pros and cons sheet and\\n\\nto five other people that you really trust and you like their opinion, ask their opinion about it. 15,\\n\\ncommit to a decision and an action. 16, commit to a date and a time if you choose to leave and 17\\n\\ncommit to a shift of total attitude. If you are going to stay, to accept what is enjoy, what is and take it\"),\n",

So I feel blessed this week to observe\\n\\nchildren's emotions and experiences and how that relates to us as an adult. What I've been privy to\\n\\nis the purity of the emotions of young Children as they are felt and expressed the need for love and\\n\\ncaring and the willingness to let go and forgive the world outside when it is not to their liking. When\\n\\nthey experience love and care uh from their surroundings, the flow of information as it comes in from\\n\\nthe outside world, how they incorporate and categorize it into their system and how each one of\\n\\nthem is a little teacher who teaches their younger sibling immediately and even correct you as you\\n\\nare making a mistake or um state things that are not um like a match to what they want to hear. So\\n\\nfor example, the cutest five year old girl was um told to cut her nails so that they won't scratch her\\n\\num or others and keep her nails clean. She saw my long my nails getting a little bit longer. And she\\n\\nsays to me you need to cut your nails so that it doesn't scratch yourself or me. And when I answer,\\n\\nthank you for letting me know. I like my nails and I want them long and I'd like would like them\\n\\nactually to get longer. And I think they're pretty and may, maybe when you're older, you may choose\\n\\nto keep them long too. She looked at me, uh trying to figure out why pretty nails could not be there\\n\\nfor little girls and it had to be there for big girls. So a week later she saw me opening something with\\n\\nkind of like my nails. She said, oh, you must be keeping your nails long so that you could open up\\n\\nthings with it. Then we were picking up label stamps and I was going like this with my long nails and\\n\\nthey were being useful to pull up the stamps. And then she says, let me use your nail to do this.\\n\\nThey're pretty useful now. So this aspect of learning using what is learned, sharing what is learned\\n\\nand the openness to see and hear information that is the opposite of what is learned before and\\n\\ninstructed. Um and find new reasons for its applicability or a spectacular process of human beings.\\n\\nWhen do we lose this amazing capability? I would close down and say that information I have\\n\\nacquired so far is enough and now I will become righteous about it or I will no longer accept any\\n\\nnew, any new or different or opposite, uh, opposite views or all views that are not similar to mine.\\n\\nUm, and obviously they're wrong and mine is the only one that is right. Well, we've seen this in this,\\n\\num, you know, uh, uh, environment that we're in and you could see that in anywhere you go see that\\n\\nin work in, in anywhere family setting. So, um, if the above sentences seem a little bit exaggerated\\n\\nto you, I invite you to see in which area of your life you have become righteous and no longer\\n\\nopening yourself up to new information to different or opposing information. Is it your intimate\\n\\nrelationship? Is it your career, parenting style, views on politics, views on society. Where is it, as you\\n\\nnotice the areas of your life that you have closed yourself to new ideas and views, check to see\\n\\nwhat happened, what event in your life made you close down. Um See if you would be open to\\n\\nconsidering expanding your experience, your outlook and your life paradigm. There's a vast amount\\n\\nof knowledge and wisdom above and beyond you waiting for you to experience it. Some people\\n\\nexperience fear of expansion, fear of the unknown and want to stick to the limited known knowledge,\\n\\nto feel safe and secure as if keeping a limiting structure would give them a guarantee of repeated\\n\\nsafe results. Soon to be stripped of that delusion from the process of life itself. Limiting yourself and\\n\\nbecoming righteous does not guarantee safety and security. It only aggravates you and everyone\\n\\nelse around you. You're not intended to be limited. Look at what human beings have accomplished,\"),\n",

Here again, this is the tip of the week. This week, I've been working on how much our\\n\\nwords matter. It can break or build our relationships, outcomes and reputation. Our words are a\\n\\nrepresentation of who we are inside. Our words are our thoughts, feelings and our behavior\\n\\nwrapped into one. The impact of a loving word can build a lifetime of confidence for our Children and\\n\\ncreate joy for our mate, friends and family. The impact of words of commitment bonds in marriage\\n\\nfor years and inspiring words can make someone at work reach their optimum potential of creativity\\n\\nand productivity in an abusive word can break your child's heart. A belittling word can damage a\\n\\nfriendship, telling a lie, breaks trust. Since our words are a combination of our thoughts, intentions,\\n\\nfeelings, and show up um through the behavior or talking or writing. Choosing our words to create a\\n\\nparticular result, becomes important. Behaviors have consequences and at times irreversible ones.\\n\\nSo we can choose to use our words to share who we are authentically or manipulate others to gain\\n\\nsomething that we think we couldn't get if we simply stated the truth. So observe yourself? Have you\\n\\nused your words to raise positivity for others to belittle them, to dump your feelings, to manipulate\\n\\nothers, to share your love, to negotiate, to request. Have you recognized the impact of your words,\\n\\nwhether they're positive or negative? Have you noticed the impact of other people's words on you,\\n\\nwhether they're positive or negative? Have you observed your own words to yourself in your head?\\n\\nThe way you talk positive or negative? Choose your words wisely.

This happens a lot in marriages when people disconnect\\n\\nafter arguments and have no idea how to repair and reconnect. So how do we mend repair and\\n\\nreconnect a a wounded relationship? I got 10 ideas for you. Right. Steps of 10 steps, observe\\n\\nwhether you're only interested in reconnecting to prove to the other person that you're right,\\n\\nobviously, that won't work and will only continue to escalate the conflict. Two clear your intentions.\\n\\nWhat do you want to create at the end of the relationship? What type of quality do you want to have\\n\\nin your relationship? Three, reflect back to the past argument and behavior and assess what part\\n\\nyou played in the conflict and the breakdown of the communication, identify which one of your\\n\\nbehaviors might have hurt them. Would you believe? Would you be willing to take responsibility for\\n\\nhow you have hurt them or have created a disconnect in that relationship? Would you be willing to\\n\\napologize for your part in the disconnection? Seven, would you consider having a quality\\n\\nrelationship worth more than being righteous about your ideas? Eight, would you be interested in\\n\\nseeing the other person's world and have compassion and understanding for their views? Nine,\\n\\nreach out with the context of reconnection and forgive them for their behavior that has hurt you and\\n\\n10, listen, listen, listen first and then share yourself with love.

This is the tip of the week. This week, I've been experiencing gratitude for many\\n\\naspects of life. I've been speaking to friends, family, colleagues and clients about their pain,\\n\\nsuffering, resiliency, and gratitude for who they are and what they have in life. Interestingly enough.\\n\\nThis week, a neighbor approached me with no apparent reason and began to insult me directly\\n\\nbecause of my political affiliation, my ethnicity, my country of origin and another neighbor took a\\n\\nstance for my rights and I was practically smiling with the highest respect for people who support\\n\\neach other and with compassion for those who are so angry um in their expression and lack of\\n\\ninterest in getting to know others. Many people share their own experiences this week with their\\n\\nfear, anger, mistrust, hope, compassion and resilience. It appears that emotions are so heightened\\n\\nthat people are having difficulty restraining themselves long enough and to regulate their emotions\\n\\nand follow through a path of logic and then intended to intend for understanding and compromising\\n\\nbefore attempting to communicate the allowance to just blast is becoming a right and a norm for\\n\\nmany pressures are high for most people around the world, many people are experiencing a loss.\\n\\nMany live in the unknown and the instability of what the future will bring. Many are angry and waiting\\n\\nto create change. Some are so angry, feel hatred and are out to destroy what has made us survive\\n\\nthrough wars, revolutions, climate disasters, economic disasters plagues pandemics. All in all has\\n\\nbeen our cooperativeness and compassion for each other. And at times, even for the ones who do\\n\\nnot think like us or have the same race or color. So observe yourself, really look at you. What are\\n\\nyou angry about? What are your losses? What is it that you need to say and haven't yet said it?\\n\\nWhat are your needs? What are you grateful for and who are you grateful for? How can you expand,\\n\\nexpand your compassion and care toward others? What are your biases? What are your prejudices\\n\\nand who do you know that you have felt prejudiced against? And from we all have experienced, we\\n\\nall have biases and we all never, never, never liked it when somebody else, we returned the favor of\\n\\nbeing prejudiced against us.

I've observed denial, perceiving the truth differently,\\n\\nmanipulating, attacking, justifying and so forth. Um All over relationships this week, obviously, we've\\n\\nseen it, most of us seen it in media um and what happened in the Capitol, but I've seen it with\\n\\ncouple of couples who have different agendas that each might be in denial of some part of the\\n\\nreality or perceive reality in their preferred way, feel entitled to the reality, manipulate to get what\\n\\nthey want, threaten to get, uh give a consequence. If they don't get their way, then attack to get their\\n\\nway. Um and ultimately justify their actions and their positions. I've seen also the same dynamic\\n\\nbetween family members like a mother with a daughter or a son or two brothers or a father with, you\\n\\nknow, their um Children or two sisters. I've also been a witness to similar dynamic between business\\n\\npartners and a lot more in between business partners. This dynamic usually happens when we lose\\n\\ntrust regarding the other person's intention, the spirit of teambuilding, friendship and the benefit of all\\n\\nattitude kind of like, you know, a win, win situation in a sense of loss over the outcome of the\\n\\nnegotiation toward our side. This dynamic usually ends relationships and partnerships and\\n\\nmarriages since um the path is only to win regardless of the consequences. I've seen this dynamic\\n\\nmany times in divorces, dissolving businesses partnerships which leaves a nasty residual feeling for\\n\\neveryone in the process. Does it need to get that be that bad? Does it? Nope, doesn't, especially if\\n\\nthere's an intention to keep the relationship such as marriages or family relationships. What does it\\n\\ntake for us not to allow destruction and only allow constructive negotiations to occur for us to keep\\n\\nthe bigger picture in sight that would benefit all in the long haul and not just self-interest, short term\\n\\ngain. It does it does take a mature and emotionally and cognitively healthy people to be able to\\n\\nnegotiate fairly and amicably amicably. So what does it take to be emotionally and cognitively\\n\\nhealthy to be able to be in control of your feelings, your thoughts and your behaviors able to handle\\n\\nlife challenges, doing a reality check and bouncing back from failures or set setbacks having high\\n\\nself esteem and have values that are aligned with compassion toward others with no intention to\\n\\nharm others. The ability to clear, clearly think, see reality as it is presented and agreed upon by\\n\\nothers around you and learn from mistakes, take responsibility and accountability for our own action.\\n\\nFeel remorse for their negative impact on others and have the skill to clear, clean and reconnect to\\n\\nothers. So observe yourself. OK, let's look at you in what areas of life and in which relationships do\\n\\nyou see yourself being emotionally healthy? Some people say that I might be emotionally healthy at\\n\\nwork. But when it comes to my relationships, I get really heated and I can't handle and I get too\\n\\nemotional or vice versa. In which scenarios or relationships you lose your emotional stability\\n\\ncircumstances, which circumstances do you find yourself in denial and refuse to see what others tell\\n\\nyou under what conditions you lose cooperativeness and will do anything to win even though it is to\\n\\nyour detriment. And how do you restore yourself and the damaged relationship to be emotionally\\n\\nand cognitively healthy. It is important to be aware and then regulate our perception, emotion and\\n\\naction toward an intended result that is beneficial to all who are part of the relationship, family\\n\\ncommunity and the world. So for gaining skills and how to become emotional and cognitively\\n\\nhealthy, go to my book Life, reset the awareness integration path to creating the life you want.\"),\n",

I wish you had an amazing year ahead, filled with love and joy a\\n\\nyear in which you experience life fully. Let me share with you how the year went for me. Each year, I\\n\\ncreate a vision for myself to commit to and attain. I've committed towards being authentic,\\n\\ntransparent, connected, happy, joyous, and passionate, loving, and accepting and forgiving and\\n\\nexpressive and most of all to be on integrity. I've kept up this way of being most of the hours and\\n\\nmost of the days and at times when I wasn't 100% there, um I shifted back to my commitments as\\n\\nquickly as possible that after I caught myself, right? This year has been an interesting one with the\\n\\nCOVID-19, creating more opportunity for me to actually see clients and even socialize online.\\n\\nAlthough it's different when I don't sit beside another person to feel their presence, I had to gain the\\n\\nexpertise to be fully present with each and every one via Zoom or facetime, I decided to uh close my\\n\\nBeverly Hills office and uh just um just be in the Orange County and um only have my office in San\\n\\nClemente and uh mostly see clients in online. So it's interesting. I miss being in people's presence\\n\\nand yet truly enjoy the comfort of my home. While I see people online, the lack of the traffic from my\\n\\nbedroom to the kitchen to my home office is delightful. The ability to hop to the kitchen for a snack\\n\\nduring the day and chat with my husband during my break is a blessing. I used to be known for\\n\\nnever being home and did not know how to staying at home. Uh norm would turn out to be\\n\\nsurprisingly, I really enjoy being um and working from home and don't have the old need or the\\n\\ndesire to always be out anymore. But my connection with my clients stayed in the same. Um And\\n\\neven at times appreciated each other more. Um It appears to me that connecting from home for\\n\\nboth my clients and I made the professional relationship a little bit warmer. Um I acknowledge that\\n\\nfor some, it just didn't work and they needed to come to the office and sitting in the office with masks\\n\\nand um and then which did not allow us to see each other's facial expression was a bit of an\\n\\ninconvenience, but yet, you know, a responsible way of being together. And uh so far has saved me\\n\\nfrom getting COVID or my clients from uh getting COVID. So there were many losses and had I had\\n\\nto grieve many normal ways of being and acting. Um I really had to grieve the ability to go to\\n\\nrestaurants and get entertained and go to on, on trips and having the, you know, friends over or\\n\\ngoing to friends houses. And there was a lot of loss, although there was a lot of gain, but, you know,\\n\\nthere was a lot of loss also. So overall, it, I went through the transition smoothly and I know that with\\n\\na lot of the people who are around me, um trying very hard to kind of like adjust to uh what it was\\n\\nand try to figure it out. And that, you know, it's no longer a short term concept. It's already been 10 to\\n\\n11 months and we don't even know how long it's gonna take and how long it's gonna be. So the\\n\\nnotion of both my husband and I working from home and being at the same location for 24 hours, it's\\n\\nvery new. Um He used to travel a lot and I used to work 12 hours a day at my office. So we made it\\n\\nactually possible and we actually made us closer previously, we both needed lots of space and not\\n\\nto kind of like suffocate each other and yet found ways to give each other room to breathe while we\\n\\nenjoy knowing that the other one is in the close vicinity and then connect multiple times during the\\n\\nday. I think that probably is the key to finding yourself being closer to each other. My promise was to\\n\\nfall in love every day and guess what I accomplished that promise I created falling in love every day.\\n\\nUm And I think that I really like this and might experience separation anxiety. If all goes back, we\\n\\nhave to go back to the previous ways. We welcomed an addition of our family and uh you know, a\"),\n",

What are your commitment to create next week, next year, next\\n\\nmonth? And how do you commit to be? And who do you commit to be?

The joy of getting gifts for all our loved ones and the\\n\\njoy of seeing their happiness and excitement when they open their presents is just great. It is so sad\\n\\nthat we can't be together at holiday gatherings and have to exchange gifts by dropping them off and\\n\\nthen have zoom festivities or sit outside in the freezing cold and just kind of like be together as we're\\n\\nwith a mask and really uh further apart and can't even hug each other. And I'm grateful the\\n\\ntechnology allows us to connect from across the world. It's been quite a holiday and yet filled with\\n\\nlove. I also have been thinking of all the people that their loved ones are not with them and they\\n\\nhave to live in their remembrance. I also have been thinking of the families that have been going\\n\\nthrough hardship and cannot have the same celebration or gift giving that they had in previous\\n\\nyears. My heart is with everyone who's feeling lonely or sad on this holiday. Please accept my love.\\n\\nMay you celebrate every day of your life for the precious being that you are. May you give love with\\n\\nno restrictions and allow yourself to receive the love that is out there for you. The assured feeling\\n\\nthat there is love in the world and all that I need to do is to feel it, receive it and own it. You will\\n\\nnever feel lonely again. Trust me. It's much easier to live in this loving world versus the projection\\n\\nthat there's a cold world out there and there's everybody's out to get me and I need to protect myself\\n\\nand nobody loves me. Yes, we all need an accurate assessment of when we need to protect\\n\\nourselves when needed. However, overall, there are more opportunities to give and receive love at\\n\\nevery moment. These times of pandemic has brought us, brought so many people together again,\\n\\ncherishing each other and valuing each other. So let's open our hearts and hands and give up a gift\\n\\nof ourselves. List everybody in your life that you want to share your love with, call them, text them,\\n\\nvideo them and let them know. Then think of all the people who you know, love you dearly. Even if\\n\\nthey haven't shared it with you, call them, text them, video them and let them know that you\\n\\nappreciate them. Look at the mirror, look at yourself and cherish yourself and tell yourself that you\\n\\nlove yourself and every part of your body and it and appreciate the body, the vessel that you actually\\n\\nlive in. We're completing 2020. Let's look at your greatness last year. What did you like in all the\\n\\nstuff that you did? What didn't you like about yourself? And you can commit to shifting those things\\n\\nand learning new skills. If you didn't like some of the things you've done, what thoughts would you\\n\\ncommit to have for 2021 what emotions would you commit to feel? What actions do you commit to?\\n\\nAnd what results are you aiming for? To get to become aware of all parts of you and integrating\\n\\nthem to feel whole and fulfilled. Read my book, Life Reset the Awareness integration path to\\n\\ncreating the life you want. Life is yours. So live joyously.\"),\n",

I've been observing the essence of family and\\n\\nfriendship, especially in these holiday times. There's a beauty in cherishing the value that our\\n\\nrelationships bring to us, although it appears that we don't choose our family. Well, I assert that we\\n\\ndo internally. We don't choose our parents or siblings or grandparents, uncles, aunts or in-laws all\\n\\nthose relationships kind of like happen to us. Yet we may choose them as valuable members of our\\n\\nworld by allowing our hearts to open and relate to them. Get curious about their thoughts, emotions\\n\\nand all that happens in their lives. We can also share who we are with them, our thoughts, our\\n\\nbeliefs, our creativity to be able to connect with them. There may also be members of our family that\\n\\nwe relate to from an obligatory place. We attend to our role as a daughter, as a son, as a cousin,\\n\\nyou know, whichever role we play, but have some judgment with them or feel judged by them. So\\n\\nkind of close up when we're around them, you know, that's the way we don't intend or don't create\\n\\nrelatedness from our heart. The other hand, we choose people to be in our life as friends, we\\n\\nchoose them based on our similarities. We may have met them through work, hobbies, socialization\\n\\nor, you know, among other friends, friends are also chosen, family members can be included in our\\n\\nworld or can be excluded if your relationship doesn't work with them anymore. We may have friends\\n\\nor family members with whom we may feel close at one time in our lives and not feel close at\\n\\nanother when you know, we don't have anything else in common due to phase of life, like changes\\n\\nthat happens in our life. You know, we move from high school to college, from singlehood to\\n\\nmarriage. We have Children. So maybe our interests are become different. Our intimate relationship\\n\\nor our mate is also a chosen relationship, which we may choose to keep the feeling of intimacy with\\n\\nor feel separated emotionally or just keep the structure of marriage due to a variety of reasons. The\\n\\nstructure of any of these relationships that I just talked about is different from the relatedness itself\\n\\nand how we hold someone close to our heart for a period of time in our life. Interestingly, the amount\\n\\nof people who are structurally structurally around us becomes irrelevant to our happiness and\\n\\nfulfillment. It is the quality of the closeness and fondness that makes us feel blessed with the\\n\\nrelationships that we have, sharing ourselves fully, sharing our love and affection, accepting others\\n\\nas who they are. Having empathy, compassion and being real. Yeah, being real creates blissful\\n\\nrelationships to become more aware and learn skills and how to create quality, intimate\\n\\nheartwarming and long lasting relationships in your life. Check out my book, I Reset the awareness\\n\\nintegration path to creating the life you want. The quality of our life is measured by the quality of our\\n\\nrelationships. So create blissful relationships with yourself and everyone around you first with\\n\\nyourself, be kind to you and then be kind to everyone happy holidays.\"),\n",

This week. I've been observing how, when we get excited about pa and\\n\\npassionate about something, a project, a task, a relationship or a person, we tend to enroll others\\n\\naround us. I've also been a recipient of someone else's excitement and passion which enrolled me\\n\\ninto their ideas. There's a transference of energy, excitement, vision and connection that happens\\n\\nwhich becomes enrolling many times when I talk about enrollment, it reminds people of selling a\\n\\nproduct. That's not what I'm talking about. We're in a process of enrollment all day with people\\n\\naround us. Let's define what enrollment is. So the Merriam Webster Dictionary defines it as to enroll\\n\\noneself or cause oneself to be enrolled. I define enrollment as the ability to share your ideas,\\n\\nthoughts and vision in a way that another person gets, it understands it and becomes inspired by it.\\n\\nBeing enrolled in this two, be curious and create an allowance to receive ideas and experiences that\\n\\ncome to us and allow inspiration and joy of the gift of novelty and expansion. So observe yourself\\n\\nand answer these following questions ready. Are you able to enroll others in ideas, beliefs or your\\n\\nvision. Are you able to enroll your spouse in some of the ideas that you have? How about your\\n\\nChildren? Can you enroll them to follow your direction or guidance? If you are the head of your\\n\\ncompany, how good are you in enrolling your staff in new ideas? If you work in a company, how do\\n\\nyou enroll the executive management to a new idea in the current divided political arena? How good\\n\\nare you in enrolling your friends and family in your perspective? What are some of the belief\\n\\nsystems that you keep re enrolling yourself on in inside your own head? You know, sometimes I, I\\n\\ncan, I have to actually enroll myself to go exercise all other parts, sometimes enroll me, like go back\\n\\nto sleep every moment. We're either getting enrolled by someone or enrolling them um into our own\\n\\nideas or who we are as a being. If we're not allowing ourselves to be enrolled, then we're resisting\\n\\nnovelty and change for the fear of the unknown. My experience is that when someone truly believes\\n\\nin an idea, believes that their ideal works and it is to the benefit of others creates an energy and\\n\\nvitality and living those ideas, puts them in the zone, it becomes contagious when you watch\\n\\nsomeone be elated by what they believe in, it elates you. So the emotional state transfers to people\\n\\naround. Interestingly enough, a person might not fully agree with the idea. However, they get\\n\\nenrolled in the state of enthusiasm, passion, wholeness, and relationship. At times of experience,\\n\\ngetting enrolled in who the person is versus their idea. For example, the way they carry themselves\\n\\nwith confidence or how love and peace radiates from them, or that their wholeness becomes\\n\\ninspiring. One of the factors of feeling, alive, elated, inspired and fulfilled is to be engaged with life,\\n\\nbeing engaged in life is to be enrolled in new ideas and allowing yourself to expand who you are. To\\n\\nall the possibilities that you're, that are waiting for you, allowing yourself toward the expansion of\\n\\nideas, perspectives and experiences, creates fulfillment to observe which belief systems you keep re\\n\\nenrolling yourself in from the past and see if they are still working for you to see if you're open or\\n\\nclose to being enrolled in other ideas as they show up in your life. Go to my book, I reset the\\n\\nawareness integration path to creating a life you want be enrolling of yourself and allow yourself to\\n\\nbe enrolled toward greatness. I'll be right back.\"),\n",

Um Just a matter of facing death, mortality and loss and the concept of um bringing\\n\\nmeaning into life and what happens when life becomes shortened by something that it wasn't, the\\n\\nperson was doing. It brings a lot of thoughts and emotions for people, thoughts and emotions that\\n\\nthey have to deal with consistently. Some people go through sadness, some go through anger and\\n\\nthey can't really put their anger on a particular subject or be mad at the person who died or be mad\\n\\nat a disease. So they start getting angry at everything that's around them and pick at everything. Um\\n\\ntheir husbands, their Children, their work. He says, if they put a question mark on every decision\\n\\nthey make, they put a question mark on the value of everything that is around. And uh even their\\n\\nown value. Am I worth it? Um Why am I doing this? Should I even make more effort? Life is so, so\\n\\nshort. Let it be. Let me just go into a space of, um, you know, recklessness because what's the\\n\\npoint? So it's almost like even daring, um, life and daring death that I'll show you, you know, either\\n\\nyou're gonna get me or I will get you and I'm in control. So for any reason you are experiencing any\\n\\nof that and you have lost someone first and foremost, I'm sorry, and my condolences and then hang\\n\\nin there because this is a process. It's a process of us facing. Um, but we don't anticipate to face.\\n\\nAnd every time we talk about death is something far away or there's always this hope and\\n\\nbargaining that it just won't happen to me and I can beat it somehow or it's something that I don't\\n\\nhave to deal with. Um So if those are part of what you're going through, just letting you know it is\\n\\nnormal and we're going to go through these processes and slowly but surely we'll find our footing\\n\\nand we become centered again and uh come back and enjoy the things that we have. Sometimes\\n\\nalso when we face that instead of it questioning everything, we actually go back into the value\\n\\ninstead of it becoming worthless, it becomes valuable. And we know that any moment this might no\\n\\nlonger be here, my body the way it is might not be here. These types of relationships might not be\\n\\nhere. These experiences might not be here so that I would value every moment as if it may be the\\n\\nlast and being with the present moment and valuing it will bring back some of the joy and some of\\n\\nthe peace of mind and allowing yourself to just be with and go into the flow of what is is going to\\n\\nbring you back and um make you valuable to yourself and everyone around you valuable to you and\\n\\nevery experience valuable again. So don't fight the sadness, honor it. You have every right to go\\n\\nthrough the grief for what you have lost and even the meaning or the safety and security that we all\\n\\nhave as an illusion that life is just gonna continue every day the way it is and um embrace the\\n\\nuncertainty and anything that you gonna do in order to take care of yourself and the rest you're\\n\\ngonna live with the uncertainty and hope for the best.

This week, I've been observing the difference between how people go\\n\\nfrom anxiety producing thoughts to calming thought processes. How I've distinguished this matter is\\n\\nthat we live in different tenses, we can live in the past, we can live in the future or we can live in the\\n\\npresent tense. We also split up the tenses into positive or negative senses. When we concentrate\\n\\non the negative past events, relive them constantly generalize. And this the decision that we made\\n\\nuh from the past. And with that, we tend to create an overall decisions that end up projecting in our\\n\\nfuture. When we want to plan our future as a protective measure, we tend to rely on our negative\\n\\npast to learn from our mistakes and be watchful to protect ourselves from future harm. There's also\\n\\na high cost and that we tend to put fear as the source of moving toward the future, which holds us\\n\\nback from moving forward. Concentrating on our positive path allows us to take our skills and\\n\\nresilience into consideration and have a fact based set of strengths and skills to carry with that gives\\n\\nus confidence toward building a positive and reality based future. Focusing on the negative past,\\n\\ncreates sorrow, helplessness, powerlessness, and ultimately depression. Focusing on the positive\\n\\npast, creates a sense of gratitude and fulfillment. Focusing on the negative future. Guess what\\n\\nproduces anxiety? We create a horror shock for ourselves about a future that we already assume\\n\\npowerless to focusing on the positive future requires faith, not in the sense of religious faith.\\n\\nAlthough that may work for what I mean by faith is to trust based on our own positive past others,\\n\\npositive outcomes and our own skills and strength that we will create a future that is planned based\\n\\non reality. Since we're set up to live in all tenses in our imagination and only be able to act from one\\n\\ntense, which is the present time. It is important to be aware and rely on our sense of confidence\\n\\ntoward our abilities to make the right choice, the right decision for ourselves. So have faith in\\n\\nyourself, your capabilities, your strengths and your wisdom.\"),\n",

And again, however it is that's totally, ok. Don't change anything. Don't control anything. Just be\\n\\naware of it. Make another deep breath, exhale. Now I bring your attention to your breathing. How do\\n\\nyou breathe? Is it easy? Is it hard? Is it shallow? Is it deep? Is it heavy? Is it light? Is your breathing\\n\\nenough or you need more air in each breath? And however it is, that's totally ok. Don't change\\n\\nanything, don't control anything. Just be aware, take another deep breath, OK. Now be present to\\n\\nyour body and imagine yourself that you're laying down on your bed, on your favorite bed, the bed\\n\\nthat you love to sleep in, either you have it or you don't have it, you can imagine it the way you like\\n\\nit. And also when you're doing this meditation, you can either do it sitting or laying down on your\\n\\nback. But if you're gonna sleep easy, so I don't suggest you so have a seat, but visualize yourself\\n\\nthat you're laying down on the bed. This bed has a very unique quality. Their home surface of this\\n\\nbed is covered with rose petals. It's your favorite color and with the favorite smell that you like it. So\\n\\nit's like you, you're completely covered by rose petals and only your face is out and with every\\n\\nbreath that you bring in, you pulled that amazing aroma of these pebbles and this per aroma is\\n\\ncoming to your body and distributed every part of your body and whatever that brings tension,\\n\\npressure, discomfort or pain to your body. Absorbs this, this aroma, absorb it, pull it to itself and\\n\\nbring it out. Any thought, any emotion that bothers you getting absorbed by these, by these petals,\"),\n",

Any thought, any emotion that bothers you getting absorbed by these, by these petals,\\n\\nrose petals. And you can see that some of these roles post they get whittled and I'm already losing\\n\\nthat freshness because they absorb what is hurting you. And all of a sudden that they get riddled\\n\\nand old they get, they get evaporated in the air and all of a sudden fresh new peals shows up. So it's\\n\\nlike you are in this bed full of rose petals that is purifying your body, your mind and your emotion and\\n\\nwith every breath, it absorbs whatever bothers your body, your mind or your emotion. And with every\\n\\nbreath this aroma goes in, cleanse your body, cleanse your mind and your emotion. Now check your\\n\\nbody and see how much your body has been changed from the moment that we started till now,\\n\\ncheck your mind and see how is your mind now and also check your emotion and see what has\\n\\nbeen changed. Take a deep breath slowly come back and open your eyes. Wow. Yeah. At the\\n\\nbeginning, as I went into my body, I felt all of the stress, all of the tension, every part of my body that\\n\\nwasn't even um present to. Now, I was feeling the tension, but also the tingling feeling of the rose\\n\\npetals coming and taking and evaporating and that part of the tension would open up and it would\\n\\ngo to the next level and to the next level. And as I was just in it, it's just every part get got deeper.\\n\\nLike that type of the medication got deeper and deeper as I connected with my body and the kind of\\n\\nlike the releasing part of it. So I feel uh fresh, I think, I feel like I needed more of it. Uh But so I\\n\\nguess, you know, you can do it as long as you want, as long as you have a technique and\\n\\nespecially, I shorten it because I just want to give you the, the structure on how it goes. You can\\n\\nstay for 15 minutes, half an hour or an hour. But if you can do it and especially if you can record it\\n\\nwith the same structure for and keep it with a nice music and record it. You can sleep every night\\n\\nwith it and it's perfect because it's purifying your body, mind and emotion. Yeah. Who wouldn't want\\n\\nto sleep in the bed of a rose petal? That's the beauty, the color you like it and the aroma and smell\\n\\nyou. Exactly. Thank you so much and thank you all.

I'm Doctor Fu JZ and I am excited to be with\\n\\nAmon La Aman who is a yoga master and a life coach. Um, hi Emman. Hi. Hi to you and everyone\\n\\neverywhere, wherever you are, you know, we go a lot of places. Well, I'm a therapist, obviously, you\\n\\nknow, when I'm uh with clients a lot of times they have a lot of emotions and sometimes I need to\\n\\nkind of like, protect myself in the room about all the emotions that are coming at me and kind of like\\n\\nsitting in my body and sometimes you go to a party or you're going to an event or something. And I\\n\\nknow, you know, with the COVID right now, not everybody is going to an event but still, I mean, you\\n\\nmight be going, standing in a line of, uh, you know, going to a store or something. And, um, there's\\n\\nsome, it's almost like other people's emotions are there and you don't want to kind of like get\\n\\ninvolved in the emotion or that somehow imagine yourself. Ok, I'm capturing everybody else's vibes\\n\\nand emotions and I just don't want to. So uh what are some of the ways that we could kind of like\\n\\nprotect our body and energy through this time? Actually, um this is another visualization technique\\n\\nand it helps very well. Uh You can do it when you're standing, you can do it when you're sitting,\\n\\nwhen you are in the middle of a party or in a meeting, it makes no difference, you can do it and\\n\\neverything is happening inside you. So nobody even notice it. But one of the things here, it's mainly\\n\\nyou visualize that there is a rose, a beautiful long stem rose on your right side, the color you like it\\n\\nwith the smell and the aroma you like it. And then another rose on your left side and each one is\\n\\nabout uh 12 inch 1 ft uh uh on the right, 1 ft at the uh left, 1 ft in front, 1 ft in the back. So four roses,\\n\\nit's like they surround me and then one rose exactly in the center of my chest, in the rib cage in here\\n\\nat the center inside my body. And then another rose you, I visualize exactly at the center of your\\n\\nskull behind your forehead. And this long stem is going down and another rose outside of your head\\n\\nstanding outside, but the stem goes all the way down. So when you look at it, it's like you have\\n\\nseven roses and you're surrounded by them and you are breathing and you're just observing and\\n\\nyou're aware about these roses, you may notice one or two or some or most of them they get uh\\n\\nwiled old willow and they are not fresh anymore in your mind. You have a new one and the last, the\\n\\nthe old one is already evaporated and then the new one is sitting in its place. And if it happened\\n\\nagain and again, you can visualize another new one, another new one till all of the roses stays in\\n\\nthat beautiful state of. We love energy and beauty. Very simple visualization and you're aware of\\n\\nyour roses and anytime any of them is little, you have a new one inside and then feel it, feel it in\\n\\nyour body, feel it with your mind in motion and see how does it, how does it feel after you visualize\\n\\nthis and you're present to it? Take a deep breath, come back, open your eyes. It's interesting that\\n\\nthe rose in my back uh withered a couple of times and I put a new one there. Last time I did this with\\n\\nyou, the left side was withering and we kept doing that this time. The the left side was fine. All the\\n\\nroses were fine. The one in the back was um shifting and kind of withering. And I got another one.\\n\\nIt's interesting because we, we've done this like back to back and each time it's another part of the\\n\\nspace that is, uh, is showing up and, uh, is cleaning up in that way or at least, like, feel like that\\n\\nyou're protecting yourself in that way. It's interesting. Yes. And, and rose has this nature. It's like uh\\n\\nthis quality that absorbs the energies that it's like some kind of a pro protection. And, uh, I think it's in\\n\\nuh some of the, uh uh some of the uh oldest scriptures, they are talking about this quality of the\"),\n",

Welcome back to the tip of the day. We are here with Amano Loga Ramon. He is\\n\\nthe yoga teacher, master yoga teacher. And um I'm really gonna ask you a question that all of us\\n\\nhave, which is due to a lot of stress. Uh There's a high ratio of insomnia, people just can't sleep.\\n\\nThey talk to me about not knowing how to fall asleep or they do fall asleep, but then they wake up\\n\\nand they can't fall asleep. So this has really become an epidemic of its own. And um although we\\n\\ntalk to them a lot about what to do with their mind and emotions and to calm it down before sleep.\\n\\nBut there's definitely a physiological aspect that can support them to go to sleep much quicker. So\\n\\ncan you please give us that tip? Definitely, definitely uh foundation uh in yoga, the best access to\\n\\nslowing down your system is through your breathing. And this is a breathing technique. It's a famous\\n\\nas a belly breathing. So we are using the belly muscle to help the lung to move in a way that we\\n\\nwant to control it. Normally, when someone is stressed and worried. They are breathing fast. Hi,\\n\\nShan. Now, our lung has this cap capability that it can act. Um It can impact on our nervous system.\\n\\nI'm Sampha and parasitic and easily can shift how we feel at the moment. So, if I'm stressed out, I'm\\n\\nbreathing very fast and very shallow. As soon as I start interrupting that with my intention and\\n\\nbreathe deeply and slowly I can shift that. So put your right hand on uh over your navel and left\\n\\nhand on your chest. And especially if you used to breathe with your upper chest, be sure that your\\n\\nleft hand is not moving. We wanna use only your right hand to go out when it's inhaled. And in\\n\\nwhere he excelled, inhale out, exhale in, inhale, your belly is coming out a and your belly goes in\\n\\ntwo more breaths. And lastly now we did the same amount of inhale and exhale with the same\\n\\nspeed. You can do like a 123, inhale, 123456 X or even go to eight. That shift it works better. So if\\n\\nyou can exhale longer, it helps you much better, especially if you're new to it. I si seriously invite you\\n\\nto do this slowly and do it between like uh 1 to 2. So if, if I do it twice on my inhale, do four on your\\n\\nexhale and then make it longer and longer. Exhale has a much more uh impactful result. How do\\n\\nyou feel right now? Doctor, I feel calm and I think um I'm also sensing that when people are\\n\\nstressed. Um and that's probably a lot of the reason where insomnia shows up. But when people are\\n\\nstressed, this is one of the best ways to just deres yourself while you're going out when you know\\n\\nyou're at work. Or there is a part of you like, even on, you know, starting to meditate whatever you\\n\\nwant to do, this probably is the best tool that you can uh come to your body, uh connect with\\n\\nyourself and start releasing um whatever it is in your body and uh calming yourself and activating\\n\\nthe paras sympathetic system where it could relax you. And obviously, as you um are doing this o\\n\\nover and over and kind of the length of it is gonna be longer than relaxing yourself will ultimately\\n\\ntake you to a sleep pattern. Exactly. I'm already getting ready to sleep myself. Now you do this, you\\n\\nrelax, it relaxes you and you can do it several times during the day. But when you wanna sleep and\\n\\nyou cannot sleep, I invite you to do this minimum for 10 minutes and normally about 10 minutes\\n\\nyou're asleep. Now you may sleep and then you wake up in the middle of the night, you can do the\\n\\nsame thing again, inhale an exit and make it as much as it's possible. Make the longer exit and it\\n\\nworks like a charm. It works always worse. And um I heard lately that even they are teaching these\\n\\nbreathings, especially the belly breathing to the people that they have a heart surgery. And I'm so\\n\\nhappy that this is happening 34 years ago. These things was not happening now. It's like uh in\\n\\nmainstream and people are hearing it and they are doing beautiful. Thank you so much for showing\"),\n",

It's great to have you with us. I'm Dr Fu Zain and I am with Amanullah Garman. He\\n\\nis a master yoga teacher and he is going to give us a technique today when your mind is too busy\\n\\nand you don't know how to control it or even be with it. He's gonna give you and me an amazing\\n\\ntechnique. So, hello, Amman. And please tell us the technique. Hello, everyone. Actually, uh this\\n\\ntechnique, it's uh the good part of it. You don't have to do anything weird. Nothing from outside. You\\n\\ndon't have to blow. You don't have to make a deep breath. You don't have to anything. The only\\n\\nthing is internally, you're shifting the way that you're looking at things. Uh right now, just make a\\n\\ndeep breath and bring your attention to your mind and see how your mind is working. Is it fast? Is it\\n\\na slow, it's a bit tired, so it's slow. But their thoughts that are just kind of like pouring in there, but it's\\n\\nvery slowly. It's not. Uh now this uh technique is very simple. Look at in front of you. It's like you\\n\\npaying attention to one point. But instead of just seeing that point in front of you, you look at the\\n\\nwhole picture like it's a peripheral vision, have a peripheral vision and look at everything with no\\n\\ndiscrimination. Don't choose any point, just be focused on that point and look at everything and at\\n\\nthe same time, make a deep breath, continue your, the way that you're looking at things and check\\n\\nyour mind and see how is your mind now. It's quiet. Exactly. It's quite what it's short. It's not dull. It's\\n\\nlike something opened up all, all of a sudden, it's quiet and it's because it's almost like my focus is\\n\\nnot inside. So I'm not going in it, the mind, uh, the vision is outside and I'm paying attention to the\\n\\nbigger picture outside. So as I am looking at the bigger picture, it's more like my focus and attention\\n\\nis outside of me, but it's calm because I'm, uh, I'm out there and the out being out there, it created a\\n\\ncalmness in my mind which there's really no thought. There's like full on observation with no thought\\n\\nnecessarily around the observation. Exactly. And when you are in that state, not only your present to\\n\\nyour front, even you can feel your back, it's like you're like a satellite and you're aware of everything\\n\\naround, uh, your surrounding. When you are in that state, your mind is slow, slowly, start, um,\\n\\nslowing down and getting sharp. It's a very simple technique. You don't have to do anything. You\\n\\ndon't have to put your hand on your nose. You don't have to shift. It's just a deep breath and bring\\n\\nyour attention to your surrounding and what you can add to it. Pay attention to your five senses at\\n\\nthe same time that you're watching your outside. So be present, you're hearing, touch, taste the\\n\\nsmell and even with open eyes, look at the whole view, it seems like it's a great opening to um\\n\\nmeditation because I think most people are having such a difficult time to begin meditating and\\n\\nstopping their thoughts. And this is an amazing opening to a deep, deep meditation. Thank you. I on\\n\\nLa Rama for being with us and for all of you, please wait for more tips coming your way. Bye bye.\"),\n",

We are here with Amano Laa Harman who is a\\n\\nyoga master teacher. And, um, you know, we really need something to wake us up in the morning.\\n\\nSometimes, you know, we have coffee, we take shower, we do all of that. And I was like, oh God, do\\n\\nI have to go through the day or you've gone through the day? And I know personally around three or\\n\\nfour o'clock in the afternoon, I feel so drowsy that I really need something to wake me up and, um,\\n\\nfor me, if I don't want to have coffee or the coffee doesn't even work for me. So at one point, what is\\n\\nit that you can let me know where it could wake me up through my body? A very simple technique.\\n\\nAnd, uh, when you, you feel um sleepy or heavy, uh, either by sleeping too much or long day, you\\n\\njust need to activate your, uh lymphatic system. How, how it works. Very simple. Turn your right\\n\\nhand and inside of your right hand is outside, put your right hand on your knee with your left hand\\n\\nand start tapping from your shoulder all the way down to your wrist. Put your hand down on your\\n\\nknee, very relaxed and just tap from shoulder to your wrist. Normally do it about 12 times here. We\\n\\nwanna save some time before we go only seven times. Now, change it, go into the other hand from\\n\\nthe shoulder all the way to wrist. Now, raise your right hand towards the ceiling. Now, bend your\\n\\nelbow and bring your hand behind your either head or your neck. Now, the right side of your lung,\\n\\nthe right side of your torso is open with your left hand, start tapping from your armpit all the way\\n\\ndown to your waist. So from the armpit all the way to the waist, the same thing here, we do it seven\\n\\ntimes when, but when you do it at home yourself, do it at 12 and change it. And the last part inside\\n\\nof your leg from your growing all the way down to your ankles. And after this last one come up,\\n\\nbreathe and bring your attention to your body, to your mind, to your emotion, to your senses, to your\\n\\nbreathing and see all of the changes. How do you feel doctor? I actually feel my body vibrating and\\n\\num I feel every cell to be alive and ready to go like ready to dance. You know, it's like that type of a\\n\\nvibration. I'm ready to dance. Excellent. Excellent. So uh you can do this thing. You can do it in the\\n\\nmorning, you can do it in the afternoon whenever you need it. Uh especially if you're, you wanna\\n\\nstop co uh drinking coffee. This is a very good helper, like a hamburger helper. This is a coffee\\n\\nhelper so that you can substitute this very simple. It's change the whole physical mood and mental\\n\\nand emotional and it's very effective. Let's call it a natural caffeine. Yeah, it's a good, it's a good\\n\\nshift. Beautiful.

I'm Doctor Fujian Zane. And I'm so excited to be with Sister Jenna, uh the founder\\n\\nof Brahma Kumaris, the meditation museum and the host of American Meditating. Uh I really wanted\\n\\nto start the series of meditation with you because obviously, um I'm not very good at meditation.\\n\\nThat's not true. And you know, it, I want to teach and teach everybody uh step by step and how we\\n\\ncan be with ourselves, especially on this time. Mm Thank you for John. It's so nice to be with you\\n\\nagain. And um let me correct the myth. Everyone can meditate and meditation is very easy. The\\n\\nquestion is, what is your focus in holding a particular thought for a long period of time? So some of\\n\\nus tend to have a thought on a broken relationship, a heartbreak, uh lack of money, Coronavirus.\\n\\nYou know, we're having a lot of meditation maybe in areas that don't make us the most strongest.\\n\\nSo um in my path of meditation, it was a great relief when I knew I didn't have to empty my mind.\\n\\nAnd I think that's what a lot of people consider meditation to be very difficult. So on my path of the\\n\\nbrahma my, I want, I want you to keep your thoughts in your mind, but select the healthy ones and\\n\\nthe ones that are connected to your vision, your dreams, your goals, your virtues, your powers, your\\n\\nbeauty. And that's when you'll feel like, oh, wow, this meditation is really awesome. OK. Um Can we\\n\\ndo uh meditation pension in uh cleaning your body? OK. You ready? Yes. Um So wherever you're\\n\\nsitting, um make sure it's quiet and you have the ability to not be disturbed and settle in, take a deep\\n\\nbreath in and out. And the recommendation is to do that three or four times to breathe in deeply and\\n\\nout. And as you're breathing in, imagine you're putting cool, cool, clean oxygen into your system and\\n\\nbreathing out anything that's toxic in the system, breathe in again, breathe out. And as you get\\n\\ncomfortable with the sound of silence emerge, the idea, the thought this body is a temple and what\\n\\ndo I place in a temple? Is everything worthy and clean? Imagine in your temple, you said as a living\\n\\ndeity, a living god or goddess, imagine you're like an angel in your temple. What food of thoughts\\n\\nwould you feed the deity, the God or the goddess or the angel? There would be thoughts that I am\\n\\nappeal peaceful and loving bee and that simple thought becomes a means of cleaning your in a\\n\\ntemple, the body is also your temple. So first and foremost, the thoughts that you feed you're in a\\n\\ntemple, takes care of what is inside images of worthiness. You be to not only visualize this but give\\n\\nyourself some time to experience it. The deity in you, the God in you, the angel in you is being fun. I\\n\\nam pure, I am peace, I love and then powerful allow that vibration to permeate through your body,\\n\\nStarting from the soul. You'll feel your eyes getting brighter, your brain tingling, your smile becoming\\n\\nmore natural, your neck being relaxed, your shoulder is no longer taking the burden of the world on\\n\\nit. You sit straight up the vibrations of taking care of your inner temple transcends throughout your\\n\\nphysical being, your heart, your kidney stomach intestines, your legs, your knees, your feet, your\\n\\ntoes, your arms, your fingers, it is receiving the food of thought. I am pure. I am peace. I love. And\\n\\nI'm powerful, breathing deeply again and exhale. And when you're ready, I invite you to return to the\\n\\nspace in a deep sense of refreshment and a living reality. Open your eyes and take another deep\\n\\nbreath, inhale and exhale. That's one meditation that you can do when maybe you have five minutes\\n\\nor so in loan. In addition to that, it's meditation you can do when you're walking and moving around,\\n\\nyou can kind of remind yourself if you're not intellectually busy means your thinking process doesn't\\n\\nhave to be invested in a project in details and trying to match a deadline. But you're just driving in\"),\n",

I'm Doctor Fujian Zane. And I'm so excited to have sister, Doctor Jenna with us.\\n\\nShe is the founder of the Brahma Karri, a meditation museum and she is the host of America\\n\\nMeditating. And I'm excited to have her to teach us meditation because we all need to meditate not\\n\\nonly right now, always but really right now. So thank you for being with us. Glad to be back with you.\\n\\nOne of the things about meditation that I think is really important is that we must understand that\\n\\nthought has power and when we recognize that our thoughts have power, we will use our thoughts\\n\\nin a very useful way. Example. Ask the self right now, are my thoughts driven by my past or are my\\n\\nthoughts driven by my future? And which one tends to be more and my thoughts from the past more\\n\\nor is my vision or my future in my thinking more? Like when you're planning something ahead, you\\n\\nhave a lot of thoughts that are programmed for that ahead, so to speak. But if your thoughts are\\n\\nfeeling or getting some sort of an influence from your past, where you feel I failed so many times. I'm\\n\\nnever going to make this happen again. Why do I bother? But you still try the thought of you feeling\\n\\nthat you're a failure will actually create more obstacles in your pushing forward. So maybe in this\\n\\nmeditation, I it might be nice for us to kind of pause for a little and deeply say to the self that I\\n\\naccept. And I know I know and I accept and I believe that these thoughts that I have are crucial\\n\\ntowards my well being. And then I need to maybe identify the power of thought and how thought can\\n\\ncore again my future and that I want to focus just on that so we can try that one for a minute or two.\\n\\nLove to. OK. Ready. Yes, I'm ready. Firstly, I'd like you to practice this one with meditating with your\\n\\neyes opened as if you're daydreaming a little and I'm not looking at you. I'm just um most of the\\n\\ntimes we're walking around with our eyes open. So with your eyes opened, I want you to simply\\n\\nbecome aware that there's an energy behind your eyes. It is you the living, being the living energy,\\n\\nconsciousness, the soul. Just imagine for a little that the spirit is behind your eyes that which feels\\n\\nthanks Jesus, the energy behind your eyes carries your stories and will decide if it wishes to let go of\\n\\nsome of the stories it's been carrying the energy behind your eyes, the soul will determine how you\\n\\nmanage the Coronavirus crisis or if you choose to be afraid and worry about the future. So imagine\\n\\nthe energy of thought, it's very powerful. And what do you think will happen if you think in this state\\n\\nof worry and fear about the present environment in the world where your future is concerned? Give\\n\\nthat a salt that thought will create an energy that will bring worry and fear into your future. Your eyes\\n\\nare still opened and you're thinking you're using thoughts behind your eyes. And what if you choose\\n\\nto look at the Coronavirus as an opportunity for you to get to know yourself better, to be more\\n\\nintrospective, to try to decode if the thoughts that flow through your mind on a day to day basis, if\\n\\nthey have a merit or purpose of meaning to you, it's meditation, it's like you're taking time to pay\\n\\nattention to the world behind your eyes. There's nothing wrong with that. So let's choose the sort of\\n\\num seeing the Coronavirus time and crisis at the moment. So now I'd like you to actually look at this\\n\\nparticular time of the Coronavirus and ask, have I been taking care of myself inside of me? Is there\\n\\nthe virus of anger, greed, attachment or fear their own thoughts when you look back at your life and\\n\\nsee what have you been doing with your thought energy up until this moment? What is it served? Be\\n\\nhonest with yourself. That's how you'll be set free. Take a few moments and ponder on that. And\\n\\neven after this meditation, grab a sheet of paper and write down how you feel you've been taking\"),\n",

That's how you'll be set free. Take a few moments and ponder on that. And\\n\\neven after this meditation, grab a sheet of paper and write down how you feel you've been taking\\n\\ncare of you internally over these years because the reality is the natural nature of you. The living\\n\\nbeing is an energy of great potential and power and truth. And the vaccine for the virus is the\\n\\nthought practice of power, truth, compassion, peace. How we can choose to approach the future of\\n\\nthis particular time is to make a commitment of taking a daily dose of being truthful to the self, being\\n\\npowerful to the self, being peaceful with the self. It's like the vaccine for the virus of anger, agreed\\n\\nego. So how you can approach the post Corona crisis? I just mentioned the Hindi word of corona,\\n\\nbut the corona crisis is to start to serve yourself deep inside with these quality of thoughts so that we\\n\\ncan start to feel the wonder instead of the fear. So I'll just give you a little sample again with your\\n\\neyes still opened. Imagine for a little bit, the world has all this anxiety about the virus instead of\\n\\nidentifying with it, all you turn inwards and you ask is there even a virus in me of anger or jealousy or\\n\\nfear cause I don't want that in me and you decide to take the vaccine of replacing your anger with\\n\\npeace, replacing your affair with love, replacing the ego, the truth, wisdom, self-respect, but your\\n\\nback. See, so let the world do what it needs to do. Don't forget your world and what you need to do\\n\\nfor it. Are you willing to protect yourself from picking up any further viruses? And are you willing to\\n\\nbecome a healer? Someone who walks with the right vaccine in you generating that energy around\\n\\nyou. So choose to respond to the future with these ideas and thoughts and it will just feel a whole lot\\n\\nmore normal or natural for you. This will be your new norm to always have the cure to feel the way\\n\\nyou want to feel, not the way the world tends to influence its emotions and feelings onto you. Thank\\n\\nyou so much. Thank you sister Doctor Jenna for another one of beautiful meditation and I just feel\\n\\nuh so calm listening to you and uh recognizing what parts of me were coming out, whether there\\n\\nwere anger or fear um and kind of getting released and coming back really uh like a white light, a\\n\\nfeeling my vibrations are getting higher and higher. So thank you for that. Um And for everyone. Um\\n\\nstay tuned for more meditation with sister Doctor Jen. Thank you. Bye bye.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 's3://drfoojandocuments/ai-videos-2024/pdfs_Aug_2024/Tip_of_the_day_-_English/98.Tip_of_the_day_-_English-transcript.pdf'}, page_content=\"Hello, everyone. I'm Doctor Fujian. And I am so excited to be with sister Doctor Jana. Uh She is the\\n\\nfounder of um Brahma Kumaris uh Meditation Museum. And um she is the host of America\\n\\nMeditating Radio and she's with us um to give us the jewel of her wisdom and meditation um for me\\n\\nand then for me to share it with all of you. Um And today, um I was gonna ask you for a favor of the\\n\\num the essence of protection and I have heard you before and I loved it and I want to share that with\\n\\nall of my audience. OK. Lovely. Well, let's go for it and see how it turns out. You know, a lot of times\\n\\nwhen I sit for meditation, I generally start with where I am. And many of you who know me very well,\\n\\nI tend to be as authentic as possible. So I don't necessarily always do well. Like if I'm just this, it's\\n\\nlike I have to start with where I am and that's what I teach individuals to do to start where you are\\n\\nbecause your most truthful part of yourself will emerge in your meditations. Of course, when you get\\n\\nsupporting tools from various um teachers that guide you in meditation, it's helpful, but I do do um\\n\\nurge you to get into the practice to really check where you are currently in your life with thoughts and\\n\\nfeelings without the circumstances that are surrounding you. And then just ask, how am I feeling\\n\\nright now? And that will begin to stir the real dialogue that you need to be having itself. OK. All right.\\n\\nSo in terms of um I'd like to position the divine meditation um comes because I'm not so fully\\n\\nattached to all my labels. And there are two forms of divine meditation that I'd like to do. But this one\\n\\nI feel is very important for the particular times that we're in when I'm attached to my name, gender\\n\\nrole religion, it thus creates some fear if system circumstances, society or relationship tries to\\n\\nchallenge me that it might take all of those away from me. I might lose my religion, I might lose my\\n\\nmoney. I might lose my status. I might lose my looks as I get older. And those can impact the way\\n\\nthe soul feels about itself. So what if we turned that energy of consciousness around? And my\\n\\nprimary focal point is to really get into the acceptance and the beauty of understanding the energy of\\n\\nthe soul is what radiates my beauty through my eyes, through my, through my mouth, through my\\n\\nbody through my religion, through my titles. What if I am able to bring the energy of light and the\\n\\nenergy of, of uh dignity, spiritual dignity and spiritual honor into the roles that I play? Then I will feel\\n\\nlike I am protected. The reason why we will feel protected is that when you live from inside out, you\\n\\nlive from a place of eternity, we live from a place of power and truth. You live from a place of infinity\\n\\nbecause the energy of the soul could never die. It can never be burnt, it can never be stripped. It\\n\\ncould never go through that sort of a physical experience that we go through. When we feel like our\\n\\nlicense is taken away from us, our partner has left us, our money has been lost. OK? So I just want\\n\\nyou to flip, just turn around your consciousness for a little and take a deep breath in and out, breathe\\n\\nin and out a few times. And as you breathe in and out and start to relax, I meditate with eyes open,\\n\\nbut it's up to you, you can gently close the more just as if you're daydreaming. And the reason why\\n\\nopen eyed meditation is so important again, as I've stressed in previous meditations is that you're in\\n\\ncontrol of what you choose to think and feel while you're with people, while you're engaged in\\n\\nactions, you can still choose how you wish to receive or perceive the situation. It always means the\\n\\nsoul's qualities and virtues. They are in charge not the events of the outside world. All right. So with\\n\\nyour eyes gently opened, you've taken you deep breath. I just wanted to say how beautiful that was.\\n\\nI just wanted to acknowledge that how important of a skill that is to be able to be with the present\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 's3://drfoojandocuments/ai-videos-2024/pdfs_Aug_2024/Tip_of_the_day_-_English/98.Tip_of_the_day_-_English-transcript.pdf'}, page_content=\"I just wanted to acknowledge that how important of a skill that is to be able to be with the present\\n\\nmoment and others while you are so in management of where the state of being, you need to be\\n\\ninternally to um to interact with the world as that. So, thank you for that. And I think that's what we\\n\\nneed more of. Um you know, when I was a young girl in my teenage years, I've often thought when\\n\\npeople meditate, they kept closing their eyes. And so you always felt like you could only meditate\\n\\nwith eyes closed. So people would always tell me I don't have time to meditate. So as I was\\n\\nmaturing and growing and understanding, there are different ways of meditation, I really adapted to,\\n\\nI want to be in control of how I think and see things with my eyes wide open in the world. And maybe\\n\\nthat's why I preferred raja yoga meditation so much. So let's dive into this experience of um breaking\\n\\naway from labels so I can feel a sense of protection and just travel with me. This one is gonna be a\\n\\nlittle slow and easy, maybe a little bit long. So just appreciate that the experience you're going to\\n\\nattain will be very lasting. So one more time, take a deep breath in and breathe out. And during this\\n\\ncrisis that we're in or during this moment in history, the fear is overwhelming. And so is the anxiety\\n\\nbecause a lot of the things that we have believed in are now being tested by the mere fact that they\\n\\nmight be taken away from us or I might be losing them that makes it so feel fearful. So we're flipping\\n\\naround the consciousness for a moment and we're gonna be working from inside out. I can lose\\n\\nmoney, but I can also gain it back. I can lose a person, but I can find someone back. I can lose\\n\\nweight, but I can also gain it back. But when I lose time, I can't gain that back. So each thought that\\n\\nyou have is connected to time. So what if you chose to simply decide to let go of your attachment to\\n\\nthe way your name sounds and the karmic energy that travels with your name that whenever people\\n\\ncall you by your name, there's a particular feeling that comes over you let that go for a little and\\n\\nobserve the experience very easily, very gently breathe it in and exhale and think about what it's like\\n\\nto let go of the attachment to your gender. You think like a woman because you look in the mirror\\n\\nand you see a woman, you think like a man because you look in the mirror and see a man. What if\\n\\nyou just chose to look in the mirror and see a soul sparkling light. You're not your gender. Observe\\n\\nthe feeling. Let go of your attachment to your role that you play your titles. If you're a doctor and\\n\\nsomebody gives you a malpractice, it could be devastating. So just let go of your title, you're not\\n\\nyour title, you're not your role. Observe how that feels. Breathe that in. Let it out. Can you imagine\\n\\nyou're no longer a mother, a father, a sister or brother, the owner of a business, an American\\n\\nPersian European black, white. Let go of all of that attachment, let go of the nationality, let go of the\\n\\nrace, let go of even your religion just for a little bit. If you have no name, gender role, title religion,\\n\\nrace as an attachment in the way you frame who you think you are and you feel a deep sense of\\n\\nprotection because nothing can harm you. You're in your mode of um eternity, immortality, you\\n\\npresent and in this awareness, we would feel God's energy gently hovering over you constantly\\n\\nprotecting and guiding and empowering you because energy connects to energy. When it's high,\\n\\nelevated and powerful, they connect and it just becomes one. So breathe that in for a little bit, inhale\\n\\nwhat you're feeling. Just exhale, allow the way you feel being unattached to become a very natural\\n\\nvibration. So you can be at a party, you can be in the car, you can be in a meeting, you can be\\n\\nisolated. You'll have the same feeling, breathe in deeply and exhale again, breath in deeply, exhale\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 's3://drfoojandocuments/ai-videos-2024/pdfs_Aug_2024/Tip_of_the_day_-_English/98.Tip_of_the_day_-_English-transcript.pdf'}, page_content=\"vibration. So you can be at a party, you can be in the car, you can be in a meeting, you can be\\n\\nisolated. You'll have the same feeling, breathe in deeply and exhale again, breath in deeply, exhale\\n\\nagain. You will always feel a great sense of protection. When you walk around being non attached,\\n\\nyou will always feel a deep sense of protection. When you walk around feeling loved and loved and\\n\\nlovable. So the energy of love has no boundaries, attachment does, the energy of love has no limits,\\n\\nattachment does. So the more we break the attachment to these limited perceptions of ourselves,\\n\\nthe more our energy of the soul, the energy behind our eyes gets expanded. So again, as I told you,\\n\\nwhen you're meditating with your eyes opened and walking and moving around, you're\\n\\ncontemplating these higher thoughts. And so wherever you go, you're spreading the fragrance of\\n\\nthat vibration into the atmosphere and into these relationships. So I hope you all enjoyed that very\\n\\nsimple, easy meditation or when you're deepening of your own personal protection as a soul, forget\\n\\nthe human dimension. It's the soul that we wish to protect. So these quality of thoughts will keep\\n\\nyour soul feeling safe and protected. Thank you for John. Thank you so much. Um And for all of\\n\\nyou, please stay tuned for more meditation from sister Doctor Jenna. Thank you.\"),\n",

I'm Doctor Fu Shan Zane and I'm here with Amon Laga Herman. He is a master\\n\\nyoga teacher and he is going to give us some techniques in when you have a lot of tension in your\\n\\nbody. And maybe this tension creates headaches for you or maybe pain for you in your body or it's\\n\\njust your attention and you really, really want to release it. So here you are, Mr Gamman. Tell me,\\n\\ntell us, please. Excellent, good. Uh No, stay everyone. Uh it's happening. Maybe we worked a lot\\n\\nand we have a heavy head or we feel a very, very tense and this technique it helps you, especially if\\n\\nyou feel it around your head, tension around your head and neck and back. It's very, very effective\\n\\nand we're gonna do it and see how it works for you. It's very simple. It's uh tapping and what we do,\\n\\nwe are going to start tapping with the fingertips exactly. Uh the start of the eyebrows and we go for\\n\\n40 taps, take a deep breath. Now come to the corner of your eyes, but don't tap it from outside, tap it\\n\\nfrom the front exactly this bone, the corner of your eyes ended that there is a bone tap on that\\n\\ninhale. An X ray. Take a deep breath, another deep breath. Now bring your hands. Continuation of\\n\\nthat bone comes over here underneath of your eye tap, tap tap on the bone in the middle part of it.\\n\\nAnother 40 inhale and exit. Now go to your upper lip underneath of your nose and start tapping\\n\\nanother 40 times. Make a breath, another deep breath go underneath of your lower lip over your uh\\n\\nChen Chen. Yeah, at the center, make another deep breath. Now we bring with two fingers, we are\\n\\ngonna uh these are clavicle and your clavicle and the ends at the center of it. There is a soft area\\n\\nunderneath of that soft area. There is a um part of your rib cage tap on that bone underneath of that\\n\\nsoft area. Inhale an x another 40 times make any breath, another deep breath x-ray. Now with your\\n\\nleft hand, his muscle that is coming close to your uh to your armpit and end to your breast. Start\\n\\ntapping in that muscle. Another 40 times, breathe deeply and slowly and change it. Make a deep\\n\\nbreath another deep breath. Now with your left hand, start tapping this the end of your pinky. And to\\n\\nstart of your wrist, this area start tapping on that left hand is tapping on your right hand. That would\\n\\nbe another 40. Make any breath, another deep breath, change your hand, take a deep breath,\\n\\nanother depressed, let go relax and check your body. Check your mind, check your emotion, check\\n\\nyour senses and check your breathing and see how much everything has been changed. I feel calm.\\n\\nMy body feels calm all over and like a lot of release and it just feels like it's lighter in here. Like I can,\\n\\nall of my five senses are really heightened in a, in a uh in a wonderful way, not like heightened, like\\n\\na um hyper vigilant, but it's heightened as if I see everything and I feel everything but in, in a very\\n\\ncalm way, kind of like a um like an energy boost that comes up. So the tension releases and there's\\n\\na feeling of energy boost that shows up for me. Very good. Perfect. Thank you so much for an\\n\\namazing technique and for all of you, we'll be back with really interesting tips from Amano Lo K. Bye\\n\\nbye.\")]"
